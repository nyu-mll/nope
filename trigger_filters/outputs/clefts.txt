But on her way to the mosaic table , the one supporting the beautiful French clock , she stumbled over an extension cord left by Rita , her hairdresser , who 'd fought a losing battle with the different voltage until two young men from Kissinger 's staff got the dryer going just before they were all due downstairs for the first toasts .

Pat herself had never seen it that way . She remembered those evenings , as well as the law firm 's partner dinners from that same all- too- brief time in her life , as being more agreeable than all the political entertainments in the years before and after . # Even Martha , for a while , had been fun . # How Rose Woods would love this room : all the figurines and bibelots , the kind of stuff she filled her little place at the Watergate with , those frilly knockoffs amidst the real little gems she got from Don Carnevale , her very safe escort from Harry Winston . # She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paving stones .

She parted the curtains and saw him down there in a windbreaker and slacks , walking with Bill Duncan , their favorite Secret Service man , and she thought back to the mad night two years ago when he 'd gone to the Lincoln Memorial , at about this hour , with almost nobody but Manolo and some aide of John Ehrlichman 's . To talk with the " demonstrators . " And a fat lot of credit he 'd got for making the effort . # She thought of the people who 'd come out to greet them this afternoon , trying to catch a glimpse of the limousine . You could scarcely see them , kept back as they were a block or more from the path of the car , but you could hear them , buzzing and cheering , interested in the whole # thing , hoping for something to come out of it whereas back home the only crowds you could gather for politics were the angry , filthy kids and their teachers . Would those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really a peacemaker ? No , of course not . # She could see Dick now , staying two steps ahead of Duncan , lost in thought until he 'd turn around and say something , half from politeness and half from the need to hold forth . And then , after he spoke a couple of sentences , he 'd break away and go it alone for another fifty feet , starting the cycle again . For all his need of an audience , he was happier alone . She remembered him just like this on their wedding day , June 21 , 1940 . She 'd looked out the window of the Mission Inn and spotted him pacing the courtyard , a nervous groom , an hour before the ceremony . The birds had been singing in the branches as she stood there in her lace suit from Robinson 's department store and watched him without his knowing it .

And both Eds , his son- in- law and much younger brother , would find open seats in New York and Washington state . This fantasy was new , another one agitated into life by too much concentration on the Kennedys . She herself never inclined to the long view . # Julie had taken to asking when she would have her portrait for the White House painted .

No harm done , thank God . Everything , the whole world , really , was so fragile . Only yesterday # there had been that horrible newspaper picture of the man attacking the Piet with a hammer . # She knew from long practice that she could , by sheer force of will , banish such an awful image from her mind .

@@4161635 MARNIE MARKOV STILL had a flush of cold on her cheeks that March afternoon when Tony walked into her gift shop . Few outsiders showed up in the middle of the day before the weekend at this time of year . She sized this one up quickly . He was not a serious shopper . His cursory glance at the merchandise was not the searching look of anyone seeking a particular gift or memento . The shop held the usual assortment of shells from around the world , the lovely floats sometimes found on the local beaches , rarer now than they had been in the past , kites , souvenir sweatshirts , gift mugs decorated with whales or fir trees Marnie knew that much of the merchandise could be found in any other shop up and down the Oregon coast , but a lot of it was unique to her shop . Handblown glass items from Bepe LaRoche ; handcrafted pottery by local artisans ; jewelry made by locals . None of these held the attention of the tall man approaching . # While Tony 's glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the merchandise , where it was , even the posted prices . His swift look at Marnie was also exhaustive . A gray-haired , pink-cheeked woman , blue eyes , sixty to seventy years old , weight within a pound or two of 135 , five feet three . She had a mole on her cheek . # He was a big man , not only tall , at least six-one or -two , but big in every dimension without appearing overweight . He walked with a limp , not bad , but noticeable . # As he moved toward her , Marnie suddenly had a vivid memory of seeing Ed approaching another counter , a long time ago . He had walked with a swaying motion unlike any she had seen before . Then , she had stood behind a Macy 's counter in New York City , not quite nineteen years old , one year out of high school in Indiana , and filled with an unaccountable dread and even fear of big , tall men . # The memory was so sharp , so immediate , Marnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relieved when the stranger came to a halt , abruptly turned , and headed toward the alcove , which was what made her shop unique along the coast . # Now , for the first time , Tipper , her wirehaired terrier , raised his head to watch the man . He was used to customers and paid little attention to them , but his job was to help guard the alcove , and he was reliable . Marnie motioned to him , and he did n't move from the floor at the end of the counter , but he was watching . # The alcove was set off with a velvet rope . Beyond the rope a pale-violet silk scarf edged with exquisite lace was draped over a low table . A small placard read CREATED BY JUSTINE LINCOLN . The table was satin-smooth cherrywood , with curved legs , and a gently scalloped edge . It had its own placard : FURNITURE HANDCRAFTED BY DAVE MCADAMS . A handblown-glass wall lamp , translucent pale green , hung above it , Bepe 's work . Behind it all on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what seemed to hold the tall man 's attention . As well it should , Marnie thought , leaving her counter to cross the shop and stand near the man . # " These are all the work of local artists , " she said , motioning toward the arrangement . # " That 's a beautiful painting , " he said . " He 's a very fine artist . " # " She , " Marnie said with a smile . " She 's a woman . " # His surprise did not change his expression of interest as he turned his attention back to the painting . He was n't surprised that a woman had done it , but that she had chosen such an unlikely name for herself . " Stef , " he said , " captured a rare mood . " # It was one of her better pieces . An impressionistic view of Newport Bay , caught when the setting sun was revealed by soft , muted peach tones on small swells in the water , on the wings of gulls in flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk . Pale yellow shone from suggestions of lights in windows onshore and in the lights of fishing boats . As he had said , the painting generated a mood . To Marnie 's mind it was a feeling of peace , the quietude found at the close of a day . # He turned toward her then . " Actually , I came in to get directions to Dave McAdams 's shop . I was n't expecting to find a miniature art gallery . " # " I showcase our local artists . Drop in again if you 're around . I change everything about once a month . There are business cards that tell where the items can be purchased . " She pointed to another table on the near side of the rope . He did not take one . # He did n't look like a salesman , Marnie decided , or a thief , either . He was dressed in a lined Windbreaker , jeans , hiking shoes , and he was too tall not to be picked out of a crowd . His hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked almost like a salon adornment ; his eyes were dark , black or close to it . His gaze held hers steadily , not the gaze of an ax murderer . But she would call Dave , she also decided . She gave him directions . # " North to Fourth Street , turn right , and he 's on the right side in the middle of the second block . His shop looks like a shed , set back quite a bit from the street . " # The man nodded . " Thanks . " After another glance at the painting , he left . # She watched him walk out , returned to her counter , and put in a call to her old friend Dave McAdams . After alerting him that she had sent a visitor his way , she looked again at Stef 's painting . She had tried again and again to understand how Stef managed to get that particular feeling of peace in her work now and then . Stef had never had a peaceful moment in her life . Restless , constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone around her , the world in generalpeace was as alien to her as confession to an atheist . # Stef had been a colicky baby , a poor student , too restless and impatient to sit still in class , to pay attention to anything that did n't feature her at its center . As an adult , nothing had changed . Stef was Marnie 's only child , nearing her fiftieth birthday , as unsettled now as she had been as a hormone-driven adolescent . Yet she managed to express through painting what eluded her in life . # * * * # DAVE MCADAMS WORKED alone , had worked alone for years after trying out two assistants decades earlier , and accustomed to solitude , he did not relish uninvited visitors . Wiry , seventy-one years old , he had sparse white hair , which was seldom seen , since his icon appeared to be an old baseball cap that had long since lost any distinguishable color or marking . What Dave liked best in life was working with beautiful wood , fruit woods , mahogany , teak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned the planks and blocks into one beautiful and useful piece after another , each one meant to be appreciated for itself . Satiny finishes , oil patiently rubbed in over and over until he had the perfect surface that would hold up under daily use and grow lovelier with age . That day he was at his bench when the visitor knocked at his door and entered when Dave grudgingly said , " Come on in . Door 's not locked . " # Marnie had told him the guy was big , but still it was a bit of a surprise to see how big . Probably 220 , 240 , and not fat . He was carrying a bulky duffel bag . # Tony stood by the door , transfixed momentarily by a strong feeling of dj vu . The shop was so like his father 's own shop had been , it was like walking through the door into the past , expecting to see his father look up , grin , and wave toward some unfinished piece of Tony 's , as if to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Everything in the workroom was neat and clean , no piles of scraps anywhere , tools aligned on a bench or hung on a rack where they belonged . The lathe was clean . Oils , sanding papers , lacquers , varnishes , stains , all lined up , stacked up . A bench with a table saw , other saws hanging from a Peg-Board His searching look came to rest on Dave , who was holding a spindle for a chair . He did n't put it down or make any other gesture to indicate that he did n't intend to go back to smoothing out a rough spot as soon as the visitor stated his business and left . # " I came to apply for a job , " Tony said . # " Do n't recall putting an ad in the paper , or hanging a help-wanted sign out . " # " I talked to Willoughby in his store in Portland . He said he could sell twice as much as you can produce , that there 's a constant call for more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring . You 're wasting your time . " # " My name 's Anthony Mauricio , " Tony said , as if he had not heard a word . " Retired . I 'll just leave this and come by to collect it in a day or two . " He was opening his duffel bag . He pulled out an object wrapped in cloth , uncovered it to reveal a box . # From across the room it looked like cherry , or something with a cherry stain , with painting on the sides and top . Not like anything that Dave did or wanted to do . " Not my kind of thing , " he said , dismissing it . # " I 'll be driving around the coast a couple of days and come back on Friday , " Tony said , again as if oblivious to Dave 's rejection . He looked around the shop , then set the box on the bench with the table saw . " I 'll leave my card , too , and a couple of pictures . A reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by the box , strode to the door , and walked out . # Dave cursed under his breath . " Damn fool ! " he muttered , and turned his attention back to the spindle , but after a moment he put it down and crossed the room to examine the fancy box . It was n't stained , nor was it painted . It was cherry . The design was inlay , a pale rosewood inlay of a leaf motif that wrapped around the box and to the top , where it opened to a fleur-de-lis . Dave picked up the box to look at it more closely . Dovetailed joints , tiny brass hinges , an oiled patina finish , top and bottom . Inside , it was just as beautifully finished . He set it down carefully and regarded it again as an object in itself . Jewelry box ? A lot of jewelry . It was twelve by fourteen , four inches deep . Love letters ? What would it be used for ? The fleur-de-lis pattern invited touching , as did the delicate stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that went into inlay like that and the reason it was seldom seen . His fingers could not discern any seam . # After another minute or two of handling the box , as if testing it , he picked up the card . There was his name , ANTHONY MAURICIO , under it a single line , RET . NYC POLICE DEPARTMENT , and under that another single line , REF . CAPTAIN MARK ROSINI , followed by a phone number . # There were three snapshots of furniture : a small table with the same fleur-de-lis pattern , a chair , boudoir chair probably , and a coffee table inlaid with pale wood scrolling . Fancier than anything that Dave produced , but usable pieces , meant to be used , or possibly to be acquired as art . He sighed and , taking the card with him , went to his desk and dialed Williard Comley , the chief of police of Silver Bay . # Silver Bay had a population of 922 citizens , and Will was its police force in its entirety . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although neither man was called into action to do much more than write parking tickets . But Dave knew that Will could get some background dope on Anthony Mauricio , whom , he had come to realize , he intended to hire , if he could afford him and if he had n't left New York City under a cloud . # * * * # USUALLY , WHEN THE days lengthened enough , Marnie walked to the shop and back home . Never in the darkest of the winter , she was too cautious for that , especially on Ridge Road , which was without any streetlamps . She and Molly Barnett split the day , Molly from nine until one , and Marnie from one until she closed at five or six , depending on customers . When business picked up , Molly came back at six and stayed until nine . On Thursday that week Marnie hung her CLOSED sign at five . A storm was blowing in with driving rain and a stiff wind , not too cold , but not good walking weather either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called Dave to tell him she 'd be by to give him a lift . His house was next to hers up on the ridge , and he had no business walking in such weather , although left to his own devices he would have done so . At his shop , she motioned to Tipper to come along , and they hurried to the door and entered without knocking . # " If you 're not ready , I 'll wait , " she said , taking off a rain hat and shaking it inside the door . # " Just a couple of minutes , " Dave said , wiping a bench top with an oiled cloth that lifted fine sawdust and held it . " Have a look at what your big guy left here . " He waved toward his desk , where he had put the box , and continued on to the sink to rinse his cloth and wash his hands . # " Oh , my , " Marnie said , examining the box . " Did he make this ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave that impression . " Dave joined her at the desk . " The guy wants a job . Guess I 'll take him on . " # Marnie looked at Dave in surprise . " Just off the street like that ? Who is he ? Where 'd he come from ? " # " Name 's Anthony Mauricio , used to be a New York detective , homicide , retired with a disability . I had Will get the lowdown on him . His captain gave him a high recommendation . " # " Disability ? What 's wrong with him ? " She was thinking of the limp . # " Shot up . A couple of operations , and that 's all I know about that . He does n't seem to be a talker , so that 's all right . " # She nodded . Dave could n't abide empty chatter , and he had so little small talk it was almost as if he were retarded , or even mute at times . She would ask Will for more information . Will loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut up most of the time . And he would n't have been satisfied with such bare bones . # * * * # THAT LATE AFTERNOON , and on into night until it got dark , Tony stood at the window of a motel several blocks from Dave 's shop and watched the storm . He had driven up the coast to Lincoln City and had spent a long time in Newport , where he had eaten in a restaurant overlooking the bay . Trying to see what it was that the artist Stef had seen out there had proved futile . The water was choppy , the sky gray , and blowing rain was pelting down slantwise . And now he was back in Silver Bay . He had to smile at the name of the town . There was no silver , and there was no bay , just a scooped-out bit of shore with sand on it . Even he , never having lived on a seacoast in his life , could see the marks made by high tides , the long , ragged-looking strands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm like the one that had arrived that day would claim even more of the beach . # Then , lying on the bed , he thought about the zigzag trail he had cut across the country after leaving New York City . Up to see his sister in Albany , down to Phoenix , Arizona , to visit his mother , who had moved there from upstate New York following the death of Tony 's father . On to Las Vegas , on again , driving a few hours every day from place to place with no destination in mind , just driving with the thought that he would know it when he saw it . He had arrived in Portland , Oregon , with that vague thought still in his head and a bit of regret that he had not yet found it , a place where he wanted to stay and stop the insane driving . # In Portland , he had decided to head north , see what Seattle had to offer , and if it was n't there , head south . Maybe near San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland , window-shopping , he had thought derisively , he had stopped at the showroom window of Willoughby 's Furniture store , where he had seen Dave McAdams 's furniture on display , two chairs with SOLD notices on them . # And now here he was in Silver Bay , Oregon , and he intended to stay here , and he intended to work in Dave 's meticulous shop . Tony 's father had been a fine craftsman , a cabinetmaker , and he had taught Tony how to use the tools , how to make things that were beautiful and could be used . # That day in Portland , gazing at the two chairs in the window of the furniture store had brought the first moment of clarity that he had experienced in a long time , he reflected , lying on a motel bed on the Oregon coast in a place he had never heard of less than a week before . He had gone to school , gone to law school , joined the police force , had used up most of his life unaware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to do , was to work with wood , to make things , to work with his hands , and not only during a stolen hour or two now and then , with the guilt that had always followed . # A moment of clarity , he repeated to himself .

" Another silence descended , short and dangerous , pulsing with heat . Hutch was the one to break it . " When did Dad change his will ? " he asked . " He did n't change it , " Maggie said without hesitation . " Mr. Carmody had the papers drawn up years ago , when my father and grandfather were still with the firm , and he personally reviewed them six months ago , after he got the diagnosis .

" I 'll be damned " Hutch muttered , his voice like sandpaper . He was dressed for ranch work , in old jeans , a blue cotton shirt and a pair of well-worn boots , which probably meant he 'd had no more notice about this meeting than Slade had . " Thanks , Maggie , " Slade heard himself say as he turned to leave . He was n't grateful ; he 'd spoken out of habit .

" I do n't give a rat 's ass about the money I 've got plenty of that anywaybut Whisper Creek has been in my family for almost a hundred years , and my great-great-grandfather built the original house and barn with his own hands . The place ought to belong to me outright . " The emphasis on the phrase my family was subtle , but it was an unmistakable line in the sand . Slade met his half brother 's fierce gaze .

All he had to do was say yes , and he could buy that little spread he 'd had his eye on for the past couple of years , pay cash for it , instead of depleting his savings for the down payment . But something prevented him from agreeing , something that ran deeper than his utter inability to act on impulse . Indirectly , John Carmody had , at long last , acknowledged his existence . He needed to be with that knowledge for a while , work out what it meant , if anything .

Half again too smart to actually break the speed limit with the sheriff looking on . With a wry twist to his mouth , Slade waited a few moments , started his own rig and pulled onto the narrow side street . He was supposed to be in his office over at the courthouse , assigning his day shift deputies to patrol various parts of the county , but he headed for the highway instead . Five minutes later , he pulled up in front of his mother 's place , an old trailer with rust-speckled aluminum skirting and a plywood addition that served as living quarters .

This week , all the words on the dusty reader-board at the edge of the gravel parking lot were even spelled correctly . Acrylic nails , half price . Highlights/perms , ten percent off . Slade smiled as he shut off the truck and got out . The shop did n't open for business until ten o'clock , but Callie already had the lights on , and , most likely , the big coffeepot was chugging away , too . As Slade approached , the door opened , and Callie , broom in hand , beamed a greeting . " Hey , " she called . " Hey , " Slade replied gruffly .

She knew Slade took his job seriously , and it was n't like him to drop in during working hours . " Is the county running itself these days ? " " My deputies are holding down the fort , " Slade answered . " Is the coffee on ?

He remembered doing all his business in Armenian and reading the Armenian language newspaper instead of The Philadelphia Inquirer . He remembered World War I. Can you imagine that ?

She swung away again , back through the crowded dining room with its little knots of people bending over coffee cups and talking without bothering to take breaths . # There were times when Gregor sat looking at Bennis and marveling that he had ever married her . It was unusual to get lucky twice with wives . It was even more unusual to have reached the age he was now and never have been divorced .

This is not the way grown-up people respond to death and dying .

She 'd been unable to keep up with the demand this afternoon , and her brother , who was supposed to restock her supply from the back room , had n't been in sight for hours .

It was the one bit of housekeeping she insisted on doing herself , despite Mrs. Malloy 's protestations . She then carefully wiped her cherished teacup against any dust particle daring to lodge there . The cup and saucer were a gift from her motherfine porcelain rimmed with real gold . Emma set the cup and saucer back atop the leather-bound volume of Sterne 's A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy . She angled the cup to best display the image on its sidea lovely painting of a graceful gondola in Venice . Emma had never sipped from the gold-rimmed cup . But she did like to look at it . To remember her mother , gone these two years . To remember a young man who had once left roses inside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual finished , Emma stowed her cleaning supplies and checked the chatelaine watch hooked to her bodice . She closed the cover with a satisfying snap . Precisely as she 'd thought . Time to go down and send off their last remaining pupil . Reaching the bottom of the stairs , she saw Edward Sims standing in the hall , fidgeting with his valise . He wore a smart frock coat and top hat , and looked the picture of a young man ready to take on the world . " All set , Mr. Sims ? " He turned . " Yes , Miss Smallwood . " Though she was only four years his senior , Emma felt a fondness bordering on the maternal when she looked at the young man who had lived with them for most of the last three years . She glanced around the empty hall . " Has my father bid you farewell ? " Mr. Sims shifted and shook his head . " I have not seen him this morning . " Emma forced a smile . " What a pity . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he wanted to be here to see you off . " Her father ought to have been there . But no doubt he had gone to the churchyard to visit her grave . Again . Mr. Sims gave an awkward smile . " Tell him good-bye for me , and thank him for everything . " " I shall . " " And I thank you especially , Miss Smallwood . I learned a great deal from you . " " You are very welcome , Mr. Sims . I wish you every success at university . " From the front window , she watched the young man walk past the Smallwood Academy sign , and down the cobbled lane , feeling the wistful letdown she often felt when a pupil left them . This time all the more , since there were no new students to replace him . The house seemed suddenly quiet and empty . She wished Mr. Sims had a younger brother . Six younger brothers . She sighed . Perhaps even amiable Mr. Sims would hesitate to recommend Mr. Smallwood as tutor , considering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how would they pay their cook-housekeeper and maid , not to mention the languishing pile of bills , without more pupils ? Emma walked to the desk in the family sitting room , pulled out the bound notebook she kept there , and flipped past previous lists : Books read this year . # Books to read next . # Improvements needed to boys ' chambers . # Economizing measures . # Places to visit someday . # New texts and primers to order for next term : None . # Diversions to improve Papa 's moods/Improvement noted : None . # Pupils by year . Her pupil lists , which had grown shorter with each passing year , included notes on each young man 's character and his plans for the future . She turned to the list from three years before , running her finger over the few names , lingering on one in particular . Phillip Weston . Kind and amiable . Second son . Plans to follow his brother to Oxford and read the law . The brief note hardly did him justice . Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pupils over the years . Seeing his name caused her to turn to another page . Another list . Prospective pupils for the future : Rowan and Julian Weston ? Emma thought again of the letter she had sent a fortnight before . She knew perfectly well Henry and Phillip Weston had two younger half brothers . Phillip had mentioned them often enough . Julian and Rowan were at least fifteen by nowolder than Phillip when he 'd been sent to the academy . But they had not come . She had broached the subject with her father several times in the past , suggesting he write to the boys ' father . But he had hemmed , hawed , and sighed , saying he was sure , if Sir Giles meant to send his younger sons to them , he would have done so already . No , more likely , Sir Giles and his second wife had eschewed their humble establishment in favor of prestigious Winchester , Harrow , or Eton . " Well , it would not hurt to ask , " Emma had urged . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore Emma , who had been acting with increasing frequency as her father 's secretary , had taken up quill and ink and written to Sir Giles in her father 's stead , to ask if he might consider sending his younger sons , as he had his older two . She still could hardly believe she had done so . What had come over her ? In hindsight , she knew very well . She had read an account of the daring travels of the Russian princess Catherine Dashkov . Reading about the princess 's exploits had inspired Emma 's rare act of braveryor foolishnesswhichever the letter had been . In the end , her letter apparently made no difference . Her assertiveness had been in vain , for there had been no reply . She hoped if Sir Giles had been offended at their presumption that word of it had not reached Phillip , who was , she believed , still away at university . Turning a page in her notebook , Emma tapped a quill in ink and began a new list . Measures to acquire new pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . There stood Aunt Jane , who had let herself in through the side door as usual . " Mr. Sims departed on schedule ? " Jane asked with one of her frequent smiles , punctuated by slightly crooked eyeteeth . " Yes . You only just missed him . " Emma set her quill back in its holder . Her aunt laid her bonnet on the sideboard and smoothed back her hair . Amidst the brown , Emma glimpsed a few silver hairs that had escaped her ruthless plucking . Jane , her father 's sister , younger by six years , had never married . She lived in the house next door , which had been their parents ' home . There she ran a sister school to the Smallwood Academya boarding school for young ladies . Jane peeled off her gloves . " Dare I ask where your father is ? " Emma shook her head . " He 's been gone since breakfast . " Aunt Jane pulled in her lips in a regretful expression , her shaking head mirroring Emma 's . Mrs. Malloy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed not in the least surprised to see Jane Smallwood there . In fact , three cups already sat upon the tray . " You will join me , I hope ? " Emma asked politely , knowing full well her aunt had planned to do so all along . " Thank you , my dear . " As if drawn by the warm trail of steam from the kettle or the smell of Mrs. Malloy 's shortbread , the front door opened and Emma 's father shuffled in , head bowed , thin mouth downturned , looking older than his forty-eight years . Mrs. Malloy bustled over to take his hat and muffler , scolding , " Mr. Smallwood ... yer shoes are a right mess ! And wet trouser ' ems in the bargain . Did ya swim ' ome ? " " Do forgive me , Mrs. Malloy , " he said dryly . Irony glinted in his round , blue eyes . " I did not step in that puddle to spite you . " He wiped his shoes and looked across at his daughter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " Emma replied . " Though you have missed Mr. Sims . " Her father blinked , clearly surprised and chagrined . " Left already ? Good heavens . I wanted to be here . I do hope you passed along my gratitude and farewells . " " Of course I did . " Her father sat down , rubbing his hands together . " Chilly day . Damp too . " " You ought not to have stayed outdoors so long , John , " Jane said . " You 'll catch your death . " " I should be so lucky , " he murmured . Aunt and niece shared a look of concern . Emma poured tea into their plain everyday cups , and conversation dwindled while they partook of the simple repast of hot tea , bread , cheese , and shortbread . Her father ate a little of everything , she noticed , though his appetite was not what it once was . Emma nibbled bread and cheese but resisted the shortbread , though it was her favorite . Her slim figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emma allowed herself sweets only at Christmas and her birthday . She sipped her tea , then set down her cup . " Well , Papa , " she began , " I have started a list . " " Another ? What is it this time ? " She felt a flicker of annoyance at his condescending tone but replied evenly , " A list of things we might try to acquire new pupils . " " Ah . " He waved a dismissive hand as though the topic were trivial . Her aunt said more encouragingly , " And what have you thought of so far ? " Emma looked at her gratefully . " A new advertisement in the paper . Perhaps expanding to other newspapers as well , though that would be expensive . A larger sign might help . Our old one is showing signs of wear , I fear . And hardly visible unless one is looking for it . " Aunt Jane nodded . " Yes , a smart , well-maintained sign is very important , I feel . " " Ours is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not as though parents go wandering through the streets in search of a tutor . " Emma weighed her best course , then said , " You are exactly right , Papa .

I am not a young man anymore . " " Oh come , John , " his sister said . " You have many good years ahead of you . " He sighed . " What a depressing thought . " With a glance at her niece , Jane said , " You have Emma to think of , John , if not yourself . " He shrugged , unconvinced . " Emma is more than capable of taking care of herself . As are you . " At that , Emma and her aunt shared another long look . If Emma did n't think of some way to help her father soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . They might very well lose their home and schoolhis only livelihood ... and hers . * * * Emma spent the next two days combing her memory and the newspapers for names of families with sons who were not already enrolled elsewhere , as far as she knew . She was hunched over the desk when Mrs. Malloy entered the sitting room with the day 's post . " ' Ere you go , love . " Needing to stretch , Emma rose and looked idly through the stack , dreading to find more bills or final notices . Her hand hesitated on one of the letters addressed to her father . The return direction : Ebbington Manor , Ebford , Cornwall . Ebbington Manor was the primary estate of Sir Giles Weston and his family . Excitement and fear twisted through her stomach and along her spine . She had all but given up hope of a reply . Because her father left it to her to open his correspondenceespecially the increasingly depressing billsshe felt only minor qualms about lifting the seal and unfolding this letter as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a twinge of self-consciousness , then read the lines written in what appeared to be a somewhat hurried hand : My dear Mr. Smallwood , # Thank you for your letter and your kind interest in my younger sons . You are correct that they have reachednay , surpassedthe age when my two older boys left us to spend a few years with you there in Longstaple . However , Lady Weston feels that our youngest are too delicate to live apart from their mamma . While I personally think the experience would be as good for them as it was for Henry and Phillip , and would no doubt strengthen their developing characters in the bargain , I feel I must defer to my wife 's wishes in this matter . # I do n't suppose you would consider coming to Ebbington Manor and teaching the boys here at , say , twice the boarding rate ? If you could but spend one year here preparing them for university , how ideal that would be for us . Of course I realize that is a great deal to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was very sorry to hear of . But if you ever desire a change of scenery , do not hesitate to let me know . You would be most welcome . Your daughter as well . # Yours most sincerely , Sir Giles Weston , Bart Good heavens , what a thought . That her father would give up his established academy to tutor two pupils . What personal service that would be ! Many young gentlemen , fresh from university but without fortune , served as tutors in grand houses . But to presume that Mr. John Smallwood would leave his home and academy to do the same ... ? Emma felt offended on her father 's behalf . Had word gotten around that the Smallwoods were in dire straits ? Emma huffed and tossed the letter back onto the pile . She stood there , stewing . But after vexation passed , she read the letter again . In reality , Sir Giles 's tone was perfectly polite , nearly apologetic to even suggest such an idea . He merely wanted to see his sons well educatedall while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Weston , Phillip and Henry 's mother , had died when the boys were quite young . And Emma knew from comments Phillip had made that his stepmother , the second Lady Weston , was somewhat difficultand that she favored her sons by birth far above her sons by marriage . Emma recalled feeling sorry for Phillip when he 'd described his tenuous relationship with the woman . Emma did not recall Henry speaking of his stepmother one way or the other , though she and Henry had not been friends and therefore had not spoken of such personal matters . Emma thought of Ebbington Manor , a place she had never seen but had often imagined , high on a cliff on the windswept Cornwall coast . Of course she would enjoy seeing Phillip Weston again . But she reminded herself that he was away at Oxford , likely in his third year at Balliol . Not sitting at home waiting for her to visit . Should she show the letter to her father ? She doubted he would even consider the notion , not when he spent hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did agree , what would she dopack up her father and send him off to Cornwall for a year while she remained behind with Aunt Jane ? On one hand , that scenario appealed to her . How many times had her aunt suggested Emma teach with her someday , eventually becoming Jane 's partner in the girls ' school , if and when she felt comfortable leaving her father on his own ? But her father still needed her . Emma had been helping him for yearsfirst during her mother 's long illness and then even more so after she 'd passed on and her father 's depression of spirits began . Emma was n't certain he was capable of managing on his own . Although , at Ebbington Manor , he would be responsible for only the boys ' education , and not the administration of an entire academyjuggling day scholars , tuition notices , as well as special sessions with the dancing master , drawing instructor , and French tutor . Yes , it might help her father if his focus were narrowed . Yet Emma could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of sending him away on his own . What if he should fail ?

He wo n't want to go . But when she broached the subject after dinner , her father stunned her by straightening and becoming alert , looking at her with more animation than she 'd seen in years . " Did Sir Giles really invite us to come and live there ? " he asked . " Yes , but ... " " Interesting notion ... " His eyes brightened as he looked toward the ceiling in thought . " Father , I assure you I did not hint at any such arrangement , only asked if he might consider sending his younger sons to us here .

The phenomenon was fairly common among rock musicians and combat veterans , was anatomically mysterious , and , apart from occasional cases of spontaneous remission , was generally incurable .

The old farmhouse was set on the gentle southern slope of the saddle . An overgrown pasture separated it from a large red barn and a deep pond ringed by cattails and willows , backed by a beech , maple , and &shy; black- &shy; cherry forest .

@@4161699 Present Day On any given day , the ten separate jails that make up New York City 's Rikers Island correctional facility hold between fifteen and eighteen thousand inmates , making it the world 's largest penal colony . Of those inmates , some three thousand are classified as mentally ill . That whopping number makes Rikers one of the largest mental institutions in the United States and the best place for a budding forensic psychiatrist like Claire Waters to study the criminal mind . Claire had worked toward this day for over a decade . After breezing through four years of medical school at Harvard , she completed an internship and residency in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital , considered one of the best and most selective programs in the country . She went on to a prestigious research position at the National Institutes of Health because she wanted to dissect and study the brains of criminals . But slicing through gray matter and staining slides of neurons every day for three years did n't give her the answers she was looking for . She knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin the last stage of her training , a fellowship in forensic psychiatry , where she 'd treat some of the sickest and most twisted minds humanity could imagine . Most days Claire was a master at hiding in plain sight . She wore her shoulder-length dark brown hair straight , the bangs just long enough to veil questioning green eyes . She never wore lipstick , eye shadow , or blushanything that might call attention to her beauty . On the subway , at Starbucks , or just walking down the street , she blended in . But today was different . Instead of her usual soft , well-worn jeans and comfortable , familiar flats , she wore a new , olive green Diane von Furstenberg suit and black Louboutin pumps , neither of which she could afford . The heels protruding from those trademark red soles made a staccato click-clack on the mottled concrete floor of Rikers Island , reverberating against the muddy-brown cinder-block walls , each step reminding her that there was nowhere to hide . Claire felt miserable in her wool suit . What had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City was always sticky hot , and the air inside the narrow corridor leading to the cell block was thick with the stench of men who desperately needed a shower . Claire wore this costume to impress the director of her program , Dr. Paul Curtin , who , despite the oppressive heat , looked remarkably cool in his blue pinstriped Armani suit as he walked beside her . In his midfifties , Curtin drew attention with his wavy silver hair and slateblue eyes . Claire was taller than average at five-seven , not including the heels she wore , but Curtin towered over her with his well-built six-two frame . He was watching her every move , which only made things worse because she almost always was nervous before the first interview with a new patient . She tried to focus on the case file he 'd given her , but her hair was a liability today , swinging into her face and obstructing her view . She was a runner , trim and in great shape , but she struggled to keep up with the man who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the New York City Marathon every year .

" Ten months into a one-year sentence for forcible touching . " " What did he do ? " Claire asked , thumbing through the file . She was increasingly anxious with each step but was determined not to show it . He gave me Quimby 's file only moments before our session because he wants to know right off the bat if I 've got the chops , Claire thought . " He pulled his pants down in front of a bunch of secretaries . " " In their office ? " " At a diner . They 'd just ordered a plate of mozzarella sticks when Quimby served up his own .

" Weenie waving is called ' public lewdness ' in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line when one of the ladies pointed out the meager size of his ' portion , ' and he tried to get her to eat it . " Claire forced a little smile at his attempt at humor as a guard unlocked the security door and they entered the cell block . Claire turned her attention to the old newspaper clippings in the file . CARNY KILLER GETS LIFE read the front-page headline from the Daily Nonpareil of Council Bluffs , Iowa . The 1985 story had two photos . One was of Beth Quimby , an attractive woman in her late thirties leaving a courtroom in a baggy jumpsuit ; the other was of Beth 's handsome son Todd , age nine , being comforted by two police officers on the day of the shooting . Claire wondered whether Todd 's murdering bitch of a mother gave a damn that her one grandiose act of violence had also killed any chance for her son to have a normal life . " Whoo-hoo . Yo , baby , let me beast that . " " Bring that kitty over here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up and saw a dozen inmates leering at her from inside their cells . She was n't sure whether to smile nonchalantly or act tough in response to their vulgar catcalls . Rats in cages . At least that 's something I 'm used to . " Ignore it , " Curtin said evenly . " Every one of them would screw their eighty-year-old great-aunt if they could . " Claire realized that he was as comfortable in this hellhole as she was n't . " This Mr. Quimby 's first time through the system ? " Curtin asked . Claire knew this was a pop quiz ; he already had the answer and was testing her again . She flipped through the file and quickly found what she needed . " No . He has a string of prior arrests . Possession of cocaine , ecstasy , crystal meth ; criminal trespass ; fourth-degree stalking ; third-degree sexual abuse ... " " Which tells us .... ? " he asked sharply . " Um , seemingly minor offenses moving toward the sexual indicate a rapist in the making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " Curtin said . " And your job is to stop him from becoming one . " They turned a corner , arriving at a secure door marked North Infirmary CommandPsychiatric Wing . Curtin pushed the buzzer beside it . " Doctors Curtin and Waters , " he said , holding his ID badge up to an overhead security camera . A buzzer sounded . Curtin pulled the door open and stepped through , neglecting to hold it for Claire . Fortunately , she caught the door just as it was about to slam shut . One more piece of evidence in the case she was building against her new mentor . The charge : jerk in the first degree with a lesser included offense of arrogant bastard . Deep down , though , Claire understood . She thought of the insults she 'd weathered throughout her academic career , the hazing every doctor had to endure . It did n't matter that she 'd graduated with honors near the top of her medical school classshe got it just as bad as everyone else . She remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bathe the delusional homeless patients . Then , as she navely sponged one down , hearing those same nurses laugh outside the door because she " fell for it . " Though she survived every one of those rites of passage and skated through residency , Claire felt lost when it was over . She thought she needed to know more about the dark recesses of the human mind before she took complete responsibility for patients . So at thirty , she decided to apply to one of the most prestigious research fellowships in the countrythe National Institutes of Healthwhere she was immediately accepted and began her study of the neuronal basis of violence and how mental illness was so intimately linked to criminal behavior . She 'd treated hundreds of patients with depression , mania , schizophrenia , the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders , and was convinced that chemical and structural abnormalities in the brain caused the impulses that drove so many people to commit crimes . Claire Waters was drawn to the patients most psychiatrists labeled as untreatable , hopeless cases with seemingly irreparable minds . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying each man 's face , she thought , They 're not hopeless . We 're just not asking the right questions . She was determined to find the right questions in her research , a groundbreaking way of seeing psychopaths not as evil automatons with no conscience , but as individuals who had never felt fear and could n't see it in others . Even as children , many of the inmates on the psych ward had tortured animals or hurt other kids because , Claire reasoned , they had a profound attention deficit that made it hard , if not impossible , for them to respond to frightening situations . Maybe , just maybe , if Claire and her colleagues could reprogram the circuitry in their brains , they would be able to recognize fear in others , which would prevent them from committing crimes in the futureif and when they were ever released from prison . It was this groundbreaking work that put Claire on Curtin 's radar . He recruited her from NIH with the lure of his prestigious fellowship and the chance to work with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " And she had taken his bait . " I want to fix them , or at least understand them , " Claire told Curtin the first time they met when he came to her lab in Washington , DC . " They did n't choose to be the way they are , just like none of us choose our parents or our childhood . " " If you truly want to make a difference , then come with me , " he said . " You will help more people in three years in my program than you will in a decade buried in some government lab . And if you get through it , you 'll be able to write your own ticket to any job you want . " She will help more people . The words echoed in her mind . So she 'd accepted Curtin 's offer . And yet here , in the prison , Curtin was aggressively questioning her as if she were a first-year med student . Which she now realized was exactly how he intended to treat her . Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would always be prepared for anything he tossed at her . " What else can you tell me about Mr. Quimby that 's relevant ? " Curtin asked , not missing a beat . He kept his pace , even though she had fallen behind . It was on her to keep up , and she was having a hard time . She told herself to walk faster , think faster , find the answers . " Once Quimby 's mother was convicted , " Claire responded , trying not to glance down at the file , " his paternal grandmother was awarded custody of him . She brought him here to New York to live with her , in the same apartment where his father was raised . " " School records ? " queried Curtin . " Straight D student . No college . " " Employment ? " " All menial jobs , " answered Claire . " Dishwasher , building janitor , security guard . Drove a cab until his first arrest six years ago , after which his hack license was revoked . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of jail . " " Social history ? " " Lived alone in a studio in Alphabet City . Never married . " " Psych workup ? " " Jail therapy records are n't in the folder . " For the first time since Claire arrived at Rikers Island , she locked eyes with Curtin . From the look on his face , Claire thought he was going to lay into her for not having the answers . But Curtin chose another target . " Of course you do n't have his records , " Curtin said . " They 're still letting the inmates run the asylum . " Claire knew his clich carried more than a kernel of truth . In fact , it came from the part of Curtin that Claire had sensed from the beginning was n't superficial bullshit , the true believer in him Claire both identified with and admired . Seven years earlier , New York City had contracted with the nation 's largest for-profit provider of prison medical services to run the infirmary at Rikers Island . Their idea of quality patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure their cellies on suicide watch did n't off themselves . In short order , the result was six " hang-ups " in six months , the worst jail-suicide record in the country . At the time , Curtin 's star was on the rise . Already in demand as an expert witness , he 'd written two books about his groundbreaking research in forensic psychiatry , both of which sold hundreds of thousands of copies . This success led to TV appearances on CNN and what used to be known as Court TV to discuss high-profile criminal trials . His natural gift at gallows humor and his ability to make people laugh about subjects as macabre as anorexia and necrophilia had secured him spots on the talk-show circuit ; he 'd done Dave , Jay , and Oprah numerous times . In less than a decade , Curtin had become known as " the Dr. Oz of Forensic Psychiatry " or , as his detractors in the psychiatric community preferred , " the Jerry Springer for Serial Killers . " But when pressed , even Curtin 's detractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd convinced numerous juries in execution-happy states to spare the lives of capital defendants whose mental illness drove them to commit murder . And his honesty was without question . More than once , some shyster would try retaining Curtin to confirm a client 's bogus insanity defense . Proving he was more than just a highly paid mercenary , Curtin would not only refuse to commit what amounted to perjury , but he also offered in each case to testify against the defendant . Within his profession , however , Curtin 's reputation as the real deal stemmed from something deeper . He believed he could prevent the mentally ill from committing crimes by attacking the problem at its source . And he had at his doorstep the perfect laboratory to prove it . Curtin viewed the suicide rate among the prisoners at Rikers Island as a moral outrage , a failure of the profession he loved . He knew most of the Psychiatric Wing 's inmates had never committed a violent crime and was convinced that early intervention could prevent them from ever doing so . Using his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered the media his services with assurances that he and the students in his fellowship program could make a difference . The city , threatened with state and federal investigations and buried in a PR crisis , was hardly in a position to refuse . Five years later , suicides at Rikers were at an all-time low , and the recidivism rate among Curtin 's patients was one-tenth the jail average . Even the number of mentally ill inmates plummeted because Curtin had convinced the powers-that-be to parole many of his patients , with two conditions : They had to continue psychotherapy , and they had to stay on their meds . The plan seemed to be working , in no small part due to the quality of students Curtin chose for his fellowship . As they stopped in front of a door marked Patient Interview , Claire Waters knew it was her chance to prove herself fit to reside among Curtin 's worthy . This was the moment she had dreaded and driven herself toward for almost ten years . She was both exhilarated and terrified , which she somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew she 'd be all right because she had the gift : the natural ability to put people at ease , to draw out their darkest secrets . Even those she barely knew would sense her deep empathy and open up to her . She was determined to show Curtin her power to connect with the sickest souls . " What you 're about to do is like nothing you 've ever done as a psychiatrist before , " Curtin said . " Dr. Fairborn and I will be observing you . " " I know , " answered Claire . " Are you ready , Doctor ? " Curtin asked . " Yes , sir , " she replied . Curtin smiled . " Go get him .

Yet life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging from one day into the next until I found I could breathe normally . # I 'm in my new home now , the bed-and-breakfast I bought less than a month ago on the Kitsap Peninsula in a cozy town on the water called Cedar Cove . I decided to name it Rose Harbor Inn . " Rose " for Paul Rose , my husband of less than a year ; the man I will always love and for whom I will grieve for whatever remains of my own life . " Harbor " for the place I have set my anchor as the storms of loss batter me. # How melodramatic that sounds , and yet there 's no other way to say it . Although I am alive , functioning normally , at times I feel half dead . How Paul would hate hearing me say that , but it 's true . I died with Paul last April on some mountainside in a country half a world away as he fought for our nation 's security . # Life as I knew it was over in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed it would be was stolen from me. # All the advice given to those who grieve said I should wait a year before making any major decisions . My friends told me I would regret quitting my job , leaving my Seattle home , and moving to a strange town . # What they did n't understand was that I found no comfort in familiarity , no joy in routine . Because I valued their opinion , I gave it six months . In that time nothing helped , nothing changed . More and more I felt the urge to get away , to start life anew , certain that then and only then would I find peace , and this horrendous ache inside me ease . # I started my search for a new life on the Internet , looking in a number of areas , all across the United States . The surprise was finding exactly what I wanted in my own backyard . # The town of Cedar Cove sits on the other side of Puget Sound from Seattle . It 's a navy town , situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a property listing for this charming bed-and-breakfast that was up for sale , my heart started to beat at an accelerated rate . Me own a bed-and-breakfast ? I had n't thought to take over a business , but instinctively I realized I would need something to fill my time . As a bonus , a confirmation , I 'd always enjoyed having guests . # With its wraparound porch and incredible view of the covethe house was breathtaking . In another life I could imagine Paul and me sitting on the porch after dinner , sipping hot coffee and discussing our day , our dreams . Surely the photograph posted on the Internet had been taken by a professional who 'd cleverly masked its flaws . Nothing , it seemed , could be this perfect . # Not so . The moment I pulled into the driveway with the real estate agent , I was embraced by the inn 's appeal . Oh yes , with its bright natural light and large windows that overlooked the cove , this B&amp;B felt like home already . It was the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dutifully let Jody McNeal , the agent , show me around , not a single question remained in my mind . I was meant to own this bed-and-breakfast ; it was as if it 'd sat on the market all these months waiting for me . It had eight guest rooms spread across the two upper floors , and on the bottom floor a large , modern kitchen was situated next to a spacious dining room . Originally built in the early 1900s , the house looked out on a stunning panorama of the water and marina . Cedar Cove was laid out below along Harbor Street , which wound through the town with small shops on both sides of the street . I felt the town 's appeal even before I had the opportunity to explore its neighborhoods. # What attracted me most about the inn was the sense of peace I experienced the moment I walked inside . The heartache that had been my constant companion seemed to lift . The grief that I 'd carried with me all these months eased . In its place came serenity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this contentment did n't last long , my eyes suddenly flooding with tears and embarrassing me as we finished the tour . Paul would have loved this inn , too . But I would be managing the inn alone . Thankfully the real estate agent pretended not to notice the emotions I was struggling to disguise . # " Well , what do you think ? " Jody asked expectantly as we walked out the front door . # I had n't said a word during the entire tour , nor had I asked a single question . " I 'll take it . " # Jody leaned closer as if she had n't heard me correctly . " I beg your pardon ? " # " I 'd like to make an offer . " I did n't hesitateby that time I had no doubts . The asking price was more than fair and I was ready to move forward . # Jody almost dropped a folder full of detailed information regarding the property . " You might want to think about it , " she suggested . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get me wrong , I 'm eager to make the sale ; it 's just that I 've never had anyone make such an important decision so ? . ? . ? . ? quickly . " # " I 'll think about it overnight , if you want , but there 's no need . I knew right away that this is it . " # The instant my family heard that I intended to quit my job at Columbia Bank and buy the B&amp;B , they all tried to talk me out of it , especially my brother , Todd , the engineer . I 'd worked my way up to assistant manager of the Denny Way branch , and he feared I was throwing away a promising career . Todd knew that I would eventually be named manager . I had given almost fifteen years to the bank ; had been a good employee , and my future in banking was bright # What the people around me failed to understand was that my life as I 'd known it , as I 'd wanted it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way I could achieve fulfillment was to find myself a new one . # I signed the offer for the inn the next day and not for an instant did my resolve waiver . The Frelingers , who owned the B&amp;B , gratefully accepted my offer , and within a matter of weeksjust before the holidayswe gathered together at the title company and signed all the tedious , necessary paperwork . I handed them the cashier 's check , and accepted the keys to the inn . The Frelingers had taken no reservations for the last couple of weeks in December as they intended to spend time with their children . # Leaving the title company I took a short detour to the courthouse and applied for a name change for the inn , christening it with its new name , The Rose Harbor Inn . # I returned to Seattle and the next day I gave Columbia Bank my notice . I spent the Christmas holiday packing up my Seattle condo and preparing for the move across Puget Sound . While I was only moving a few miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Cedar Cove was a whole other worlda quaint town on the Kitsap Peninsula away from the hectic world of the big city . # I knew my parents were disappointed that I did n't spend much of the holidays with them in Hawaii , a family tradition . But I had so much to do to get ready for the move , including sorting through my things and Paul 's , packing , and selling my furniture . I needed to keep occupiedbusywork helped keep my mind off this first Christmas without Paul . # I officially moved into the house on the Monday following New Year 's Day . Thankfully the Frelingers had sold the inn as a turnkey business . So all I needed to bring with me were a couple of chairs , a lamp that had belonged to my grandmother , and my personal items . Unpacking took only a few hours . I chose as my room the main floor bedroom suite the Frelingers had set aside as their own area ; it had a fireplace and a small alcove that included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for a bedroom set , as well as a small sofa that sat close to the fireplace . I particularly enjoyed the wallpaper , which was covered in white and lavender hydrangeas. # By the time night descended on the inn , I was exhausted . At eight , as rain pelted against the windows and the wind whistled through the tall evergreens that covered one side of the property , I made my way into the master bedroom on the main floor . The wild weather made it feel even cozier with a fire flickering in the fireplace . I experienced none of the strangeness of settling into a new place . I 'd felt welcomed by this home from the moment I 'd set foot in the front door . # The sheets were crisp and clean as I climbed into bed . I do n't remember falling asleep , but what so readily comes to mind is that dream of Paul , so vivid and real . # In grief counseling , I 'd learned that dreams are important to the healing process . The counselor described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most common are dreams about our loved onesmemories that come alive again . # The second type are called visitation dreams , when the loved one actually crosses the chasm between life and death to visit those he or she has left behind . We were told these are generally dreams of reassurance : the one who has passed reassures the living that he or she is happy and at peace . # It 'd been eight months since I 'd received word that Paul had been killed in a helicopter crash in the Hindu Kush , the mountain range that stretches between the center of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan . The army helicopter had been brought down by al-Qaeda or one of their Taliban allies ; Paul and five of his fellow Airborne Rangers had been killed instantly . Because of the location of the crash it was impossible to recover their bodies . The news of his death was difficult enough , but to be deprived of burying his remains was even more cruel . # For days after I got the news , hope crowded my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somehow my husband would find a way back to me . That was not to be . Aerial photographs of the crash site soon confirmed that no one could have possibly survived . In the end , all that really mattered was that the man I loved and married was gone . He would never return to me , and as the weeks and months progressed I came to accept the news . # It 'd taken me a long time to fall in love . Most of my friends had married in their twenties , and by the time they were in their mid-thirties , the majority had already started their families . I was a godmother six times over . # On the other hand , I had remained single well into my thirties . I had a busy , happy life and was involved in both my career and family . I 'd never felt the need to rush into marriage or listen to my mother , who insisted I find a good man and quit being so picky . I dated plenty but there was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life until I met Paul Rose . # Seeing that it 'd taken me thirty-seven years to meet my match , I did n't expect love to come to me twice . Frankly , I was n't even sure I wanted to fall in love again . Paul Rose was everything I 'd ever hoped to find in a husband ? . ? . ? . ? and so much more . # We 'd met at a Seahawks football game . The bank had given me tickets and I had brought along one of our more prominent clients and his wife . As we took our seats , I 'd noticed two men with military haircuts sitting next to me . As the game progressed , Paul introduced himself and his army buddy and struck up a conversation . Paul told me he was stationed at Fort Lewis . Like me , he enjoyed football . My parents were keen Seahawks fans , and I 'd grown up in Spokane watching the games on television after church on Sundays with them and my younger brother , Todd . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we left the game that afternoon , and we saw each other nearly every day after . We learned we shared much more than a love of football : we shared the same political inclinations , read many of the same authors , and loved Italian food . We even had a Sudoku addiction in common . We could talk for hours and often did . Two months after we met , he shipped out to Germany , but being separated did little to slow our budding relationship . Not a day passed that we were n't in contact in one way or anotherwe emailed , texted , Skyped , tweeted , and used every other available means we could to stay in touch . Yes , we even wrote actual letters with pen and paper . I 'd heard about people claiming to have experienced " love at first sight " and I had scoffed . I ca n't say it was like that for Paul and me , but it was darn close . I knew a week after we met that he was the man I would marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he claimed all it took was one date . # I will admit this : love changed me . I was happier than I could ever remember being . And everyone noticed . # At Christmastime a year ago , Paul flew back to Seattle on leave and asked me to be his wife . He even talked to my parents first . We were crazy in love . I 'd waited a long time and when I gave him my heart , it was for forever. 
@@4161703 They brought the big man in on a winter night when the moon looked as hazy as the heart of an ice cube . It took three cops to wrestle and handcuff him . They threw him in their undercover cruiser and drove him to the New Hyde mental hospital . This was a mistake . They should n't have brought him there . But that was n't going to save him . # When they reached the hospital , everyone got out . The big man refused to walk . The three cops mobbed around him , trying to intimidate , but to the big man they just looked like Donald Duck 's nephews : Huey , Dewey , and Louie . A bunch of cartoons . It did n't help that they were dressed in street clothes instead of blue uniforms . # Dewey and Louie walked behind the big man and Huey stayed up front . The big man 's hands were cuffed behind his back . Dewey and Louie pushed him like tugboats guiding a barge , one good shove and he floated toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so empty , so quiet , that their footsteps echoed . # New Hyde looked like a low-rent motel . Bland floral-print cushions on the couches and chairs , the walls a lackluster lavender . There were no patients waiting around , no staff members on hand , not even an information desk . But Huey , the lead cop , knew where he was going . The big man frowned at the dcor and the empty seats . He 'd thought they were taking him to a lockup . What the hell kind of place was this ? He got so confused , his feet stopped moving , so Dewey and Louie gave him another shove . # They reached the far end of the lobby and found a hallway . The cops turned right but the big man went left . It might 've looked like an escape attempt except that the big man stopped himself after two paces . So confused he actually turned back to look for them . Huey , Dewey , and Louie were watching him now , to see what he would do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Huey raised his right hand . He wore a chunky silver diver 's watch that looked expensive even under the hospital 's terrible fluorescent lights . He beckoned and the big man stepped closer to them . It was quiet enough that the cops could hear him lick his dry lips . # Now this guy was big but let 's put it in perspective . He was n't Greek mythology-sized ; was n't tossing boulders at passing ships . He was n't even Green Mile-sized ; one of those human-giant types . He stood six foot three and weighed two hundred seventy-one pounds , and if that does n't sound big to you , then you must be a professional wrestler . The dude was big but still recognizably human . Beatable . Three smaller men , like these cops , could take him down together . Just to get that straight . # The big man returned to his captors , without a word , and once again they all moved in the same direction . # The hallway was clear and empty , just lavender walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big man could see that the runway ended at a big old door , heavy like you 'd find on a bank vault . Unmovable . This was no Motel Six . His footsteps faltered . But this time the cops were n't going to let him wander off . Dewey yanked that big boy backward , by the handcuffs . His shoulders popped in their sockets and his face went hot with pain . # " Now he 's scared , " the lead cop said . # They reached the door . A small white button sat in the wall . Huey pressed it and kept his finger on the button . The buzzer played on the other side of the door and sounded like a duck 's quack , as if Huey was throwing his cartoon voice . # The secure door featured a window the size of a cereal box . With his finger still steady on the buzzer , Huey peeked through it . # " Just break the glass , " Dewey said . # He seemed to be joking , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his diver 's watch against the window . " You could n't shatter this shit with a bullet . " # The big man opened his mouth . He had plans to speak but found no words . He could n't stop staring at that door . Not wood , not faux wood , fucking iron . Maybe . The damn thing had rivets in it , like it had been torn off a battleship . Bombproof ; fireproof ; probably airtight , too . # He finally found the words . " This place is locked up tighter than your Uncle Scrooge 's vault . " # Huey turned away from the door . His eyes brightened with joyful cruelty . " You think these jokes are going to save you , but they 're only making things worse . " # Louie said , " He 's just trying to get one of us to hit him . So he 'll have a lawsuit . " # Dewey said , " We did n't hit him before , why would we start now ? " # Huey said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not thinking logically . " # " What the hell does that mean ? " the big man asked . # " We think you might be a danger to yourself because of your mental condition , " Louie added sarcastically . # The big man 's body went rigid . " What mental condition ? " # Dewey said , " You attacked three officers of the law . " # " How was I supposed to know you were cops ? ! " # To be fair , the big man had a point . The three men wore plain clothes . Their shields , hanging around their necks on silver chains , were tucked under their different colored sweatshirts . But who cared ? Here was one rule you could count on : You were never allowed to punch a cop . So forget about punching two of them , repeatedly , and trying hard to connect with the third . It did n't matter if they were in uniform , wearing plain clothes , or rocking a pair of pajamas. # But before he could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , an eye appeared on the other side of the unbreakable window . # Well , a head at least , with a mess of grayish white hair , but the only part they could make out clearly was that eye . The outer ring of the pupil was blue but closer to the iris the color turned a light gray . Cataracts . The other eye was shut because the person squinted . Man or woman ? Hard to say , the face was smooshed so tight against the pane . The clouded pupil swam left then right , as alien as a single-cell organism caught under the objective lens of a microscope . It surveyed the big man , and the three cops . It blinked . # The big man frowned at the person in the window . Dewey and Louie unconsciously stepped backward . Only Huey , still pressing the white button , did n't seem startled by the watchful eye . He smiled at the big man , more broadly than he had all night . Relishing what he would say next : " Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in the wall right above the door : NEW HYDE HOSPITAL . FOUNDED IN 1953. # Dewey said , " When can we leave ? " # Just then the eye seemed to slip away from the window and another face replaced it . This new person stood farther from the glass so they could make out more of him . A man . Brown-skinned . With puffy cheeks , a soft chin , and a nose as round as an old lightbulb . He wore glasses . A bushy mustache . And a scowl . # They could see his chest , the tie and jacket he wore . An ID card , sheathed in plastic , hung around his neck on a plastic cord . # The big man said , " He wears his ID on the outside , see ? That 's how people know what his job is.

The brown man then stared up at Huey again and brought one finger to his lips in a shushing motion . Huey pulled his hand away so quickly , you would 've thought the buzzer had just burnt him . # The bolt lock in the door turned , clacking like the opening of a manual cash register 's drawer . Then the door opened with surprising ease for its apparent weight . The doorway exhaled a stale , musty smell . # They could now see the brown man fully . His big round face fused right onto his round body . Imagine a wine cask , upright , wearing glasses . Not tall and not fat , just one solid oval . # And yet he must be someone with authority , if he had the keys to open this mighty door . Which was good enough for the big man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown man looked up at the big man . " I 'm not a judge , " he said . " I 'm a doctor . " # The doctor narrowed his eyes at Huey , who suddenly seemed bashful. # The doctor said , " I did n't expect to be seeing you again . " # Huey nodded , looking away from the doctor . But then he seemed to feel the gaze of his partners , and he snapped out of his shame . # " This is legit . He jumped two of my guys . " # The big man appealed to the doctor . " I thought they were meatheads , not cops . " # The doctor looked at the two cops on either side of the big man . He smiled , which made his bushy mustache rise slightly like a caterpillar on the move . He stepped aside and invited them in . " My team is waiting down the hall , " he said , locking the door behind them . " Second room . " # The cops led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter than before . They did n't like the meathead line . Huey , with the watch , rested one hand on the big man 's shoulder and together the quartet followed the doctor . # The room looked like nearly any medium-sized conference room you 'll ever find . The walls were an eggshell white , a dry-erase board hung on one of them with the faintest red squiggles half erased in an upper corner . A pull-down screen hung on another wall . In the middle of the room sat a faux-wood table , large enough to seat fifteen , but ringed by only fourteen faux-wood chairs with plastic padded backs . Another ring of cheaper , foldout chairs was placed against the walls . The working class of meeting spaces . All the people already in the room looked as tired as the decor . # Tonight the full intake team was in attendance : a social worker , an activity therapist , a registered nurse , three trainees , an orderly , a psychologist , and a psychiatrist ( that was the brown man ) . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their shift , but then the cops called ahead and said they were bringing in a new admission , so the doctor demanded that everyone stay . The team had been waiting on the big man for two hours . This was not a cheerful group . Ten people , plus three cops , plus the big man . It would be a crowded , grumpy room . # Before the guest of honor arrived , the men and women on staff had sat at the table with notepads and files spread out in front of them , doing busywork for other patients while they waited . Some used cell phones to make notes , or to text , or answer email . The orderly , at the far end of the table , watched a YouTube video on his phone and sagged in his chair . # When the cops brought the big man into the conference room , the staff members leaned backward , as if a strong wind had just burst in . The doctor pointed to a faux-wood chair that had been pulled back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " # Huey brought the big man to the chair and unlocked his handcuffs . He then took the big man 's right wrist and handcuffed it to the arm of his chair . The staff watched quietly and without surprise . Only the orderly looked away from the scene , replaying the video on his phone . # Once the big man settled , the doctor walked to the open door of the conference room . Somewhere outside the room , farther down the hall , deeper into the unit , buzzing voices could be heard . A television playing too loudly . The doctor pushed the door shut , and the room became so quiet that everyone in it could hear , very faintly , the bump-bump-bump coming from the orderly 's cell phone . The tinny thump of music playing over small speakers . # The doctor walked the length of the room and chucked the orderly on the shoulder as he passed to collect a folding chair for himself . # He set his plastic chair in front of the big man and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm Dr. Anand , " he said . " And I want to welcome you to New Hyde Hospital . This building , this unit , is called Northwest . " # The big man looked at the other staff members . A few of them managed a New York smile , which is to say a tight-lipped half-frown . The others watched him dispassionately. # Dr. Anand -- like the big man , like most of the people in this room -- had been raised in Queens , New York . The most ethnically diverse region not just in the United States , but on the entire planet ; a distinction it 's held for more than four decades . In Queens , you will find Korean kids who sound like black kids . Italians who sound like Puerto Ricans . Puerto Ricans who sound like Italians . Third-generation Irish who sound like old Jews . That 's Queens . Not a melting pot , not even a tossed salad , but an all-you-can-eat , mix-and-match buffet . # Dr. Anand was no stranger to the buffet table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a working-class guy from an Irish neighborhood . He dropped those r 's when he was n't being careful . He sounded like he was talking through his nose , not nasal but surprisingly high-pitched . # The big man was n't concerned with ethnography just then . He had n't said anything since crossing the threshold of the big doorway . That 's because he was n't actually there . Only his body filled his chair . The rest of him lagged a little behind . It was still back in the lobby . # The big man knew he should be listening to this doctor . If anyone could explain how soon he 'd be released , it must be the barrel-chested Indian dude squatting on the dinky chair right in front of him . But he just could n't do it . His ears felt stuffed up and his mind fuzzy . He wanted to turn and look over his shoulder , try to find that lagging part of him that would make sense of this moment . He did n't actually move , for fear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you 're here ? " Dr. Anand asked . # The whole room waited for his answer . # Except for the orderly , who pulled out his cell phone again , muted the device , and tilted his head down toward the screen .

@@4161704 Chapter 1 # The admissions process to get into the Atwood School had eaten up six months of the previous winter , and driven each of the families nearly to distraction with open houses , meet and greets , intense interviews with the parents , sometimes two of them , and screenings of each child . Siblings had some preferential advantage , but each child was evaluated on their own merits , whether he or she had a sibling in the school or not . Atwood was one of the few coed private schools in San Franciscomost of the old established schools were single sexand it was the only one that went from kindergarten through twelfth grade , making it highly desirable for families who did n't want to go through the whole process again for either middle school or high school . # The admissions letters had come at the end of March , and had been anticipated with the same anxiety as an acceptance to Harvard or Yale . Some of the parents admitted that it was more than a little crazy , but they insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous school , which gave each child the individualized attention they needed , carried enormous social status ( which they preferred not to acknowledge ) , and students who applied themselves in the high school usually went on to great colleges , many of them Ivy League . Getting a kid into Atwood was a major coup . There were roughly six hundred and fifty students , it was well located in Pacific Heights , and the ratio of teacher to students was excellent . And it provided career , college , and psychological support counseling to the students as part of the routine services it offered . # When the big day finally came for the new kindergarten class to enter the school , it was one of those rare , hot Indian summer September days in San Francisco , on the Wednesday after Labor Day . It had been over ninety degrees since Sunday , and in the low eighties at night . Such hot weather happened only once or twice a year , and everyone knew that as soon as the fog rolled in , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be back to temperatures in the low sixties in the daytime , brisk chilly winds , and the low fifties at night . # Usually , Marilyn Norton loved the hot weather , but she was having a tough time with it , nine months pregnant , with her due date in two days . She was expecting her second child , another boy , and he was going to be a big one . She could hardly move in the heat , and her ankles and feet were so swollen that all she had been able to get her feet into were rubber flip-flops . She was wearing huge white shorts that were too tight on her now , and a white T-shirt of her husband 's that outlined her belly . She had nothing left to wear that still fit , but the baby would arrive soon . She was just glad that she had made it to the first day of school with Billy . He had been nervous about his new school , and she wanted to be there with him .

So she was happy to be there , and Billy was holding tightly to her hand as they walked up to the modern , handsome school . The school had built a new building five years before , and it was heavily endowed by parents of current students , and the grateful parents of alums who had done well . # Billy glanced up at his mother with an anxious look as they approached the school . He was clutching a small football and was missing his two front teeth . They both had thick manes of curly red hair and wide smiles . Billy 's smile made her grin , he looked so cute without his front teeth . He was an adorable kid and had always been easy . He wanted to make everyone happy , he was sweet to her , and he loved pleasing his dad , and he knew the way to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered everything his father told him about every game . He was five , and for the past year he had said he wanted to play football for the 49ers one day . " That 's my boy ! " Larry Norton always said proudly . He was obsessed with sports , football , baseball , and basketball . He played golf with his clients and tennis on the weekends . He worked out religiously every morning , and he encouraged his wife to do the same . She had a great body , when she was n't pregnant , and she 'd played tennis with him until she got too big to run fast enough to hit the ball . # Marilyn was thirty years old and had met Larry when they both worked for the same insurance company eight years before when she got out of college .

Every woman in the place thought he was gorgeous and wanted to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were married when she was twenty-four . She got pregnant with Billy very quickly , and had waited five years for their second baby . Larry was thrilled it was another boy , and they were going to name him Brian . # Larry had had a brief career in baseball , in the minor leagues . He had a legendary pitching arm , which everyone felt certain would get him to the major leagues . But a shattered elbow in a skiing accident had ended his future in baseball , and he had gone to work in insurance . He had been bitter about it at first , and had a tendency to drink too much , and flirt with women when he did . He always insisted it was just social drinking . He was the life of every party . And after Marilyn married him , he left the insurance company and went out on his own . He was a natural salesman , and had established a very successful insurance brokerage business , which afforded them a very comfortable lifestyle , and plenty of luxuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marilyn had never worked again . And Larry 's favorite clients were the professional major-league athletes who trusted him and were his mainstay now . At thirty-eight , he had a good reputation and a very solid business . He was still disappointed he was n't a pro ballplayer himself , but he readily admitted that he had a great life , a hot wife , and a son who would play ball professionally one day , if he had anything to do with it . Although his life had turned out differently than he planned , Larry Norton was a happy man . He had n't come to Billy 's first day of school because he was having breakfast with one of the 49ers that morning , to sell him more insurance .

The teacher was pretty and young , with long blond hair . She looked like she was fresh out of college . Her name tag said that she was an assistant teacher and her name was Miss Pam . Billy was wearing a name tag too . And once in the building , Marilyn took him to his classroom , where a dozen children were already playing , and their classroom teacher greeted him immediately , and asked him if he 'd like to leave his football in his cubby so his hands would be free to play . Her name was Miss June , and she was about Marilyn 's age . # Billy hesitated at the question and then shook his head . He was afraid someone would steal his football .

Why do n't you go play ? I 'll be right here . " She pointed to a tiny chair , and with considerable difficulty lowered herself into it , thinking that it would take a crane to get her out of it again . And with that , Miss June walked Billy to the building blocks , and he got busy making a fort of some kind with the largest ones . He was a big boy , both tall and strong , which pleased his father . Larry could easily imagine him as a football player one day . He had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , and his own dream for the boy , even before that , when he was born a strapping ten-pound baby . Billy was bigger than most children his age , but a gentle , loving child . He was never aggressive with other kids , and had made a great impression during his screening at Atwood . They had confirmed that he was not only well coordinated for his size , but also very bright . Marilyn still had trouble imagining that their second son would be as wonderful as Billy . He was the best . And he forgot about his mother as he got busy with the blocks , and she sat uncomfortably on the tiny chair and watched the other children who came in. # She noticed a dark-haired boy with big blue eyes arrive .

Sean and Billy began playing side by side , helping themselves to the blocks , and paying no attention to each other . # -- Michael Kingcaid Scribe Inc. www.scribenet.com # main telephone : 215.336.5094 Ext. 125 facsimile : 215.336.5092 # 7540 Windsor Drive Suite 200B Allentown PA 18195 # 842 South Second Street Philadelphia PA 19147 # 233 North Federal Highway Suites 61-3 Dania Beach FL 33004@@2126 CHAPTER 1 2:00 November 1 Patapsco State Park , near Baltimore , Maryland # Honor Mackenzie shivered , and not just because the temperature had dipped to near-freezing .

And because eyewitnesses reported seeing fiery bits of the plane falling due north of the explosion , Honor 's search and rescue squad was sent into Patapsco State Park . Her unit included a couple of young guys just returning from Texas , where they 'd earned wilderness certifications . Like thoroughbreds at the gate , both chomped at the bit to prove they could keep up with more experienced personnel .

@@4161708 Prologue # The midday summer sun in Lisbon was dazzling and harsh . But while nearly everyone else was inside taking a siesta , the Duke of Windsor , formerly King Edward VIII of England , kept up his British habits , even on the continent . # He and his wife , Wallis Simpson , the woman for whom he 'd abdicated the throne and now known as the Duchess of Windsor , sat outside at the Bar-Caf Europa , which catered to tourists and British expats . The town square was nearly empty , except for a young American couple walking arm in arm and a few pigeons strutting and pecking for crumbs in the dust . # Wallis , slender and elegant , wore a scarlet Schiaparelli suit , a bejeweled flamingo brooch , and dark glasses . She sipped a Campari and soda , the ice cubes clinking against one another in her tall glass . Next to her , the Duke , slight and fair-haired , toyed with a tumbler of blood-orange juice and read The Times of London .

Good to see yousit down , " the Duke said . # " Thank you , Your Highness , " Schellenberg replied in accented English , sitting down on the delicate wire chair . The Duke and Duchess had befriended Schellenberg on their tours to Germany before the war , visiting with Prince Philip of Hesse and Adolf Hitler . # " Hello , Walther , " Wallis said . # Schellenberg removed his Nazi visor hat , with its skull and crossbones , to reveal thick brown hair parted in the center and glistening with a copious amount of Brylcreem .

Technically , neither Hitler nor Schellenberg needed to address her that way , as she 'd never been awarded HRH status by the current king , a snub indeed . His wife , Queen Elizabeth , referred to Wallis only as " that woman . " # As she offered her hand to Schellenberg to be kissed , the scent of L'heure Bleue mixed with Mitsoukoa heady mix of carnations and oakmoss , Wallis 's signature scentwafted around her in the heat . # " They threw a rock at our window last night , Shel . " The Duke frowned . " Shattered the glass . Could have killed us. " # " I know , sir . Terrible , just terrible . " And he did knowSchellenberg himself had arranged the rock-throwing incident in order to frighten the Windsors , leaving false clues to make it look as though British Intelligence were to blame . If the Windsors were scared enough they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was certain of it . # " It 's terrible , " Wallis said , smoothing her glossy black hair , cut down the middle with a narrow white part . " They hate us . The British just hate us now . " # " Now , now , dear , " Edward said , reaching over to take her hand . " It 's not the British people . It 's Churchill and his thugs . And my brother and that wife of his . Silly old Bertie as King George VI , indeed . It 's as if I 'd never been King ! " # " You ca n't abdicate and eat it too , dear , " Wallis said with a tight smile . # Schellenberg cleared his throat . " I 've heard from the Fhrer. " # " Oh , how lovely !

He took a small folded piece of paper from his pocket , put it on the table , and pushed it toward the Duke . If fear alone could n't persuade them , perhaps money could . # The Duke of Windsor waited , simply looking at the note for a few heartbeats , then reached for it . Slowly , he picked it up and opened it . He read the number and then handed the slip over to Wallis . She examined it , arching one perfectly plucked and penciled eyebrow , then handed it back . # " Quite a bit of money , Shel , " the Duke said , pushing the paper away . # " But it 's not just about the money , sir , " Schellenberg said , placing the paper in one of the ceramic ashtrays and then lighting it , letting it burn away to ash .

Your younger brother , the present king , has aligned himself with Winston Churchill and his gangsters . He wo n't be permitted to stay on the throne , of course . " # " Of course , " Wallis murmured . She had no love for either the King or Queen , who had never acknowledged her and , in her opinion , had taken every opportunity to humiliate her . Why her husband could n't have simply stayed on the throne when he 'd married her , she would never understandor forgive . # " And his daughter , Elizabeth , raised with the same propaganda her father espouses , ca n't reign either , so . . .

Believe me , with continued heavy bombing , Britain will soon be desperate for peace . The people will panic and turn against Churchill and Edenand the current King , too , of course . Which presents the perfect opportunity to bring me back as sovereign . " The Duke sighed . " Of course , I ca n't officially support any of this , you know . " # " What other options do you have ?

" he asked her . # The Duchess took a moment for a long exhale , blowing out a thin stream of blue smoke . It had been a long few years for her . First there was her affair with him , when he 'd been the Prince of Wales . The unexpected death of his father , King George V , had been both shocking and painful for both of them . Their relationship nearly collapsed when Edward had taken the throne , crushed by the disapproval of the rest of the royal family . # They 'd thought , perhaps foolishly , that once the family got to know her better , they 'd accept her .

Even in the bright sunshine of Portugal , they had their good days and bad . # " We 're going to enjoy ourselves at the villa of our good friend , Ricardo do Esprito Santo Silva , for now , " she replied , finally . " Ifand only ifGermany invades . . . " She shrugged her narrow shoulders . # " you can count on us to do the right thing , " the Duke finished . " For the British people , of course .

However , since 1938 , the town was also the home of what was officially known as the Government Code and Cipher School . But those in the know referred to it as Station X. Or War Station . Or just the initials B.P. , for Bletchley Park . # The Bletchley estate , the former manse of Sir Herbert and Lady Fanny Leon , was a red-brick Victorian monstrosity in a faux-Tudor style . Now , under government control , it bustled with men and women in uniform , as well as civiliansmostly men in baggy wrinkled trousers and herringbone tweed jackets with leather elbow patches . The house 's formerly lush lawns were flattened and worn from all the foot and bicycle traffic . The gardens had been trampled to make room for hastily assembled huts and office buildings . # Although it was a secret to most who worked there , the real business of Bletchley was breaking Nazi military code . The cryptographers at Bletchley Park had a reconstructed Enigma machine used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a code key used in the Norway campaign , and two keys used by the Nazi air force . Though they received a huge volume of decrypts , they still could n't be used for practical purposes . Under the leadership of Alan Turing , Peter Twinn , and John Jeffreys , they were still waiting and working , hoping for a miracle . # The Nazis thought their codes were unbreakable , and they had good reason to believe so . When a German commander typed in a message , the machine sent electrical impulses through a series of rotating wheels , contacts , and wires to produce the enciphered letters , which lit up on a panel above the keyboard . By typing the resulting code into his own machine , the recipient saw the deciphered message light up letter by letter . The rotors and wires of the machine could be configured in an almost infinite number of ways . The odds against anyone breaking Enigma were a staggering 150 million million million to one . # Benjamin Batey , a graduate of Trinity College at Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hut 8 trying to break Nazi naval decrypts . Batey had been toiling away for eight months in the drafty hut . It stank of damp , lime , and coal tar . # His office was one room of a dozen , divided by flimsy partitions made of plywood . The noise from the other workstations drifted aboutlow conversations , thudding footsteps , a shrill telephone ring , the steady clicks of the Type-X machines in the decoding room . # The harsh fluorescent overhead light cast long shadows across the concrete floor as Batey and his officemate , both youngish men in rumpled corduroy trousers and heavy wool sweaters , worked at mismatched battered wooden desks piled with sheaves of papers . Thick manila folders with top secret stamped in heavy red ink across them were heaped haphazardly on the floor , dirty tea mugs were lined up on the window 's ledge , and steam hissed from the paint-chipped radiator . Blackout curtains hid the view . # Usually a prodigious worker , Batey could n't wait to leave . He had a date . # " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " asked James Abbot , his officemate . Abbot was young , but his face was pale and drawn , and he had dark purple shadows under his eyes . They all looked like that at Bletchley . Sleep was considered an unnecessary extravagance . # Batey was not amused . " I do n't kiss and tell , old thing , " he said , shrugging into a wool coat and wrapping a striped school scarf around his neck . # " I say , " said Abbot , putting his worn capped-toe oxfords up on the desk and leaning back , " at least comb your hair . Or what 's left of it . " # It was true . Batey might have been only in his late twenties , with a face that still had the plushness of youth , but already his dark hair was receding . It could have been genetics , or the prodigious stress Batey was under as a boffin , as the cryptographers were called at Bletchley . Generally , he was too sleep-deprived and distracted to give his appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the confines of B.P. , the boffins were at the top of the pecking order , as far as the women there were concerned . # It was the first time Batey had been viewed by the fairer sex in such a positive light , and , suddenly , he was in demand . And so , while at first he believed it was absolute insanity that someone like Victoria Keeley , who turned heads at Bletchley with her tall , slim figure , pale skin , and dark hair , would be interested in someone like him , he 'd slowly grown to accept and even appreciate it . # There was a knock at the door . Abbot 's eyebrows raised . # Batey cracked the door open , but it was too late , Abbot had already caught sight of who it was .

" She batted her eyelashes as Abbot gasped and nearly fell over in his chair . " The walls are thin , Mr. Abbot , " she admonished , as he tried to right himself . # She turned to Batey . " Are you ready ? " She already had her gray overcoat on and was finishing pinning on her black velvet hat .

" I thought this day would never end , " she said , nuzzling his neck . # " Not here . " He still needed to dispose of the papers in his hand .

Misty Dawson had been skipping class for the past week . Attendance records showed she was in school , but when it came time for English , she disappeared off the radar .

She 's smart and she 's always prepared . Why ? Do n't tell me she skipped English again ? " Laura nodded . " Afraid so , and I just do n't get it .

Cal , of all people , should know that . Betty had gone after him for a violation of the morals clause in the teacher contract and created a whole hoopla that had required school board intervention before being resolved in Cal 's favor .

Then she missed a day here or there , but a week ago she simply stopped coming . That tells me something 's going on in my class that upsets her . Or maybe she 's having a problem with another student who 's in there . I ca n't figure it out . " " But are n't most of the juniors taking the same courses ? " Nancy asked .

In fact , until the past few years , when developments had begun popping up on the fringes of town , the school had barely had five hundred students in grades nine through twelve . Over the ten years that Laura had been working here , though , that number had started to climb . Classrooms were more crowded , and most core courses had to be taught multiple times during the day to accommodate the growth . Last year they 'd had to add portable classrooms for the first time to accommodate the overflow until money could be allocated for new construction . However , there were comparatively few advanced placement students , and they did wind up in many of the same classrooms .

" " Then you know what I mean , " Laura said , pleading for understanding . " I also know Katie deserved the punishment she got , " he said . Laura sighed . " On some level I know you 're right , but something makes me believe there 's more to this , and that I need to understand what that is . " She knew firsthand what a rush to judgment could do to damage an already fragile teen . If she had n't had a teacher on her side years ago , she 'd have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in her had driven Laura into teaching herself . She met Cal 's gaze . " I swear to you , though , I wo n't wait much longer before talking to Betty . " " Fair enough , " Cal agreed . " I 'll talk to Katie when I get home tonight . Maybe she 'll have some ideas . She 's in that same AP class , right ? " " She is , " Laura confirmed . " And doing very well , by the way . " Cal hesitated , his expression thoughtful . " You know , I ca n't help wondering if it 's just some weird coincidence that Katie was caught skipping and suspended . At the time she flatly refused to say why she was doing it , but she must know if there 's some sort of dare the girls are taking to see if they can skip without getting caught . " " I remember being shocked about Katie 's behavior , but I had n't put it together with what 's going on with Misty , " Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think it could be a game to them , even with suspension as a consequence ? " Cal shrugged . " Kids that age do n't always look ahead to the consequences . I doubt that Katie did . I can think of a few times over the years when the seniors have dared the younger students to do some pretty crazy stuff . Usually , though , it happens at the end of the year , when they figure the rules are more relaxed and graduation 's just around the corner . Still , I would n't rule out some kind of informal hazing activity . " Laura shook her head . " I 'd expect this kind of behavior from the usual troublemakers , but kids like Katie and Misty ? It 's a shock . " " I 'll do what I can to help you get to the bottom of it , " Cal offered . " Kids tend to see and hear things we miss . If Katie 's picked up on something , I 'll let you know . The guys in the locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are rumors around here , I eventually hear most of them . " Laura nodded . " Thanks , Cal . I 'd appreciate it . " " I 'll keep my eyes and ears open , too , " Nancy promised . " Any insights would definitely be welcome . I know I ca n't put off talking to Betty forever , " Laura said . " I think I 'll scout around right now and see if I can find Misty . She 's the one with all the answers . If I have to , first thing next week I 'll have her called out of one of the classes she is attending . " She really hoped to solve this before a very bright student landed in the kind of trouble that could wind up hurting her very promising future , just the way Vicki Kincaid had kept her from making the second biggest mistake of her life . Misty Dawson had waited until after the bell , then taken refuge in the stairwell for the second time that day . She 'd been there only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaved a sigh at the sight of her , then came and sat shoulder to shoulder beside her .

And you 've already been suspended for skipping class once because of me . They 'll probably expel you next time . " " I knew you 'd be hiding out again . You have math this period and I know you have n't been going . I only have study hall right now and I told the teacher I needed to use the restroom , " she said , holding up her hall pass . She gave Misty a worried look . " You ca n't keep skipping classes just because Annabelle 's a total jerk . Do n't you think Ms. Reed and Mr. Jamison are going to notice ? " " Mr. Jamison never takes attendance , " Misty replied . " And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he has no idea whether I 'm in class or not . As long as you let me know when the tests are coming up and I show up to take those , he wo n't have a clue . " " We 're not in the same AP math class , though , " Katie protested . " They had to divide us into two groups , remember ? One of these days he 'll give the tests on different days , and then what ? " " I 'll deal with that if it happens , " Misty insisted . " Well , Ms. Reed is neither blind nor dumb , " Katie told her . " She 's bound to notice . Just tell her what 's going on , Misty . She 's pretty cool . I think she 'd get it . Maybe she could even help . " Misty shook her head . " I ca n't take the chance , Katie . Who knows what Ms. Reed would do ? Whatever it is , it will just make things worse with Annabelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie a pleading look . " You know I 'm right . You know how mean Annabelle can be .

Mrs. Litchfield will tell everyone it 's my fault , that I must have done something just awful to her precious darlin ' for her to do these horrible things . " " I still say Ms. Reed would believe you , " Katie countered , not relenting . " Or why do n't you tell your mom and dad and let them handle it ? " Katie made it sound so simple , as if the whole world would be ready to leap to Misty 's defense . Misty knew , though , that nothing in her life these days was simple . " Come on , Katie . I ca n't do that , " she replied wearily . " My parents are barely speaking to each other . Mom 's so mad at Dad , she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She just wants me and my brother to be invisible . She seems to have this crazy idea that if the house is perfect and Jake and I are little angels , Dad will change his mind about wanting a divorce . " Katie nodded , her expression filled with understanding . " I remember what that was like . I was only six when my mom and dad got divorced , and I did n't totally get what was going on , but there was way too much fighting that made my mom cry all the time . Even though I hated it when my dad moved out , things got so much better after that . And once my mom started seeing Coach Maddox and they got married , everything 's , like , a thousand times better at home . " Misty sighed .

No way . Leave it alone , Katie . It 's my problem . I 'll figure something out . " " You need to do it soon , Misty . You 're gon na get caught . Look what happened to me . Mom and Cal came down on me even harder than Mrs. Donovan did . I 've never seen my mom so furious . She even made me scrub the whole locker room at The Corner Spa , and believe me , that was gross .

Katie looked shocked . " You do n't mean that . You love school ! You 're on track to get a scholarship , Misty . It 'll be on your transcript if you 're suspended .

The cry was such as her own children made when she was gone too long searching for food to bring back to the den . It was the cry of something blind and helpless , a cry of hunger . She heard it and she could do no other thing but go toward it . # How it came to be alone in the tallgrass is a story for another time . She heard it with her sharp pointed ears and smelled it with her sharp black nose . Her nose told her the truth . It was not a wolf pup but a human baby , alone on a bed of prairie grass under the starry dark . She smelled on the breeze the horses that had come and gone , running hard . They had run away pulling a wagon that scarred deep ruts in the grass . # Her paws stepped in these ruts , found the gouges the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sniffed the ground and raised her nose and sniffed the wind .

The fire would be here soon and find where the baby lay in his nest of grass . # She could not resist his crying because she was a First Mother who had birthed many children , and there were no others like her in this valley that smelled of smoke and terror . Her children had grown fat and happy until the coming of the Trapper the past moon , the Trapper who had killed her Mate , scattering the others , and then found the den where she had hidden her pups away . # The cries of the human baby traveled through the night and found her ears and went into her ears and into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet gone dry , where milk recently flowed from her nipples to feed her pups and make them strong .

The child might as well have come from the stars themselves . And now it was alone here as she was alone . She did not think what to do , even if the baby bore the same tainted smell as the Trapper .

Her milk flowed out of her , emptying her of all she had to give , but her heart was full , as full as the night sky above . # When the child was done feeding she opened her jaws , clenched the white cloth , and lifted the child from the grass . She carried him away from the smell of burning where the prairie grasses would soon blossom with flames . The child rocked to and fro in his hammock of cloth .

@@4161803 Johnnie Riggs was a night owl . Tonight he sat at a table at the Kitty Cat Club on Sunset Boulevard , watching a little blonde pole dancer with the hottest body he 'd ever seen and trying like hell not to get an erection . He reached for the Bud Light sitting in front of him , took a swallow and set the barely touched bottle back down on the table . He was n't there to get drunk . He was n't there to get turned on by some sexy little piece of fluff . He was there to make a collar and a nice chunk of change . A former Army Ranger with a P.I . ' s license , Johnnie spent most of his time in the bars and clubs of Los Angeles , digging up information for clients who could afford his fees . And the occasional recovery job , if the money was high enough . He glanced around the club , one of the better run strip joints in the area , a place an out-of-town businessman could go for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get mugged when he walked outside to catch a cab .

Tate knew Johnnie was there to collect a skip , but Tate was a stand-up guy who did his best to stay on the right side of the law , and having a pervert aroundJohnnie 's targetwas n't good for business . It was dark inside the club except for the neon beer signs behind the bar and the soft glow of lights over gilt-framed photos of nineteen-fifties strippers that hung on the walls . A row of colored spotlights lit the woman performing onstage . The place smelled like stale beer and cheap perfume , and rock music hid the sound of clinking bar glasses and the heavy breathing of the men . Customers sat in the darkness at small round tables sipping whiskey or beer , staring toward the entertainment with big smiles on their faces . Johnnie did n't blame them . He 'd be wearing a big smile , too , along with a raging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the woman on the stage .

She was n't just petite , she was dainty , little more than five feet tall , with the shiniest , straightest , long blond hair he 'd ever seen . Short bangs fluttered across her forehead above a pair of blue eyes that made him shift in his seat against his growing arousal , and muttering a curse between his teeth . The music played , the beat steady , loud and erotic . She raised a red spike heel , wrapped her calf around the pole and slid up , then sank back down , rubbing the pole between her pale , perfectly proportioned legs . He felt a tug in his gut so strong he had to shove back his chair and get up from the table . Grabbing his beer bottle , he walked to the back of the club where he could survey the room and put a little more distance between him and the scrumptious piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping a careful watch for his target . Earlier in the week , he 'd gotten a call from his Ranger buddy in Houston . Trace Rawlins owned a security firm with branches in Houston and Dallas . In the years since they 'd left the army , they had worked together a dozen times , most recently on an abduction case that had led them into Mexico . According to Trace , a guy named Ray Carroll had jumped bail and was on the run . Rumor was he had friends in L.A. and odds were good that was where he had gone to ground . Good ol ' Ray had been arrested for possession and trafficking in child pornographythe lowest of the low as far as Johnnie was concerned . He would have taken the guy down for free if he 'd had to , which fortunately he did n't . The case was interesting because Ray was the grandson of the late Texas oil billionaire , C. P. Carroll . C.P. 's widow was filthy rich and she doted on her grandson , which , with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight risk . His bail had been set at a half-million dollars , which his grandmother had posted . But Ray had taken off for parts unknown , leaving grandma on the hook for a boatload of money if her boy was n't caught and brought back to appear in court . For ten percent of the bail fee , a cool fifty thou less a referral fee to Trace , Johnnie had agreed to find him . Surprisingly , once he 'd started digging , narrowing his search had n't been all that hard . Since leopards did n't change their spots and jackals like Ray were fairly predictable , it did n't take long to find out that Carroll hung out in the local strip clubs . The Kitty Cat was his favorite . According to the bartender who ID 'd the photo Johnnie had shown him , a guy calling himself Ray Conners had been in the club both Wednesday and Thursday nights . Johnnie had come in on Friday and again tonight but so far had n't seen any sign of him . Not until now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin slice of street noise into the club . Recalling the photo , Johnnie recognized Ray Carroll as he ambled over to the bar . He was an average-looking forty-year-old , with thinning brown hair and the kind of greasy smile you 'd expect to see on a creep like him . He sat down on one of the black vinyl bar stools , and the bartender , a tall , spare , good-looking Hispanic guy named Dante , flashed Johnnie a heads-up glance before taking Ray 's drink order , a double Grey Goose martini on the rocks . A cocktail waitress walked past . The girls who performed also served drinks , though for that they wore a few more clothes . This one , a brunette , was tall and svelte , dressed in a little blue satin two- piece number , the bottom cut high on the sides , a built-in push-up bra shoving her heavy cleavage nearly over the top . Not indecent , but definitely less than the old bunny outfits they wore at the Playboy Club . Johnnie sipped his beer , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . The dancer , Angel Fontaine , being not much bigger than a kid , was Ray 's favorite according to Dante . He watched as she dipped and swayed to the music , the red sequins on her nipples flashing in the spotlight , the light changing color to the rhythm of the music . Johnnie tried to look away , but found himself as mesmerized as the drunks at the tables . Like the rest of her body , her breasts were perfectly formed , not too large , not too small and tilted provocatively upward . Her face was n't perfect , he had finally gotten around to noticing . Her mouth was a little too wide , making her pouty lips a little too pronounced . Her cheeks were as flawless as rose petals but her chin was a little too pointy . She was the sexiest woman Johnnie had ever seen . She turned , thrust her pale , luscious ass into the air and wiggled it suggestively , and his groin tightened .

Johnnie noticed the folded dollar bills in one hand as he approached the little blonde . Another man beat Ray to her , leaning over and stuffing a ten-dollar bill into Angel 's sequined G-string , the scrap of red barely covering the spot every guy in the place dreamed of touching . Angel whirled away from him and smiled , mouthing a thank-you . When she turned her back , raised her arms above her head and began swaying to the hard rock beat , another man stuffed a bill into the glittering strip of red around her waist above that sweet little ass . Ray moved closer , hovering as Angel approached the edge of the stage . He leaned toward her , stuffed the money into her G-string . He was grinning when he turned away , his mind on pussy instead of escape . Johnnie made his move , slamming into Carroll , knocking him over an empty table , both of them crashing to the floor . Ray struggled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifted and hauled him to his feet . Johnnie caught sight of the club 's big Asian bouncer moving toward them , but he did n't seem to be in much of a hurry . Guess he 'd got word about the pervert , too . Carroll squirmed in his grasp . " What the fuck ? Who the hell are you ? " " I 'm your worst nightmare , " Johnnie said , cranking the arm a little higher , eliciting a satisfying grunt of pain . " I 'm the guy who 's gon na make sure you get back to Houston safe and sound . " Ray stumbled a couple of times as Johnnie 's heavy frame propelled him forward , slamming him into the wall beside the door . " I 'm the guy who 's gon na put your sorry , sick ass back in jail .

Amy managed to nod . " I will be in a minute . " It was one thing to be out there beneath the spotlights , dancing almost naked as Angel Fontaine , another entirely to be just a normal woman again . Onstage , she could fool herself into thinking she was Angel , a woman who enjoyed every catcall , every wolf whistle from the men she danced in front of without her clothes . An illusion she worked tirelessly to achieve . But it did n't last long once she stepped out of the spotlight . " That was quite a scene . " Babs cocked her head toward the side door where the brawny , dark-haired man had just hauled a scummy-looking customer out of the club . Amy followed Babs 's gaze . As if she had n't noticed the brawl just a few feet in front of the stage . " Dante says the creep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He certainly looks the part .

" Hard to miss a guy who looks like that . " Amy grinned back . " No kidding . " Six feet of solid muscle , barrel-chested with a thick neck and shoulders . As he 'd walkedmore like swaggeredtoward the stage , she 'd noticed a tattoo of an eagle on his very impressive biceps . Every move he made spoke of power and strength , and in a rugged , masculine way , he was handsome . " I asked Tate about him , " Babs said . " Says his name is John Riggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretty much anything else he can make a buck at . " Babs rolled her eyes . " What a hunk . " Just hearing the words brought his image to mind : dark brown hair and eyes such a deep brown they looked black , strong jaw roughened by the shadow of a beard . He was the kind of guy who should have Dangerous stamped on his forehead . Amy 's mind slipped back to her performance onstage and the way he had looked at her , his eyes following her every move . She had never felt a gaze so intense . It was late , nearly closing . Amy blew out a breath , suddenly exhausted . " You look like you could use a cup of coffee , " Babs said as they reached the small apartment they shared and Amy unlocked the door . There were other small apartments down the hall , cheap places for the girls to live . " I put on a fresh pot before I went downstairs . " " Sounds good .

She was n't a stripper , a pole dancer , a lap dancer or anything the least bit similar . She was a schoolteacher from Michigan , a woman who had absolutely no business being naked up onstage . They crossed the studio apartment : two single beds , a kitchenette , and a small living area with a sofa and chair . Babs went to the kitchen counter and took down two mugs , pouring coffee into each one . Amy grabbed her robe from the hook beside the door , slipped it on and breathed a sigh of relief once she was more decently covered . Babs was still wearing her dark blue satin cocktail waitress costume , sexy but no worse than the bikinis women wore on the beach . She took the mug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tiny round table in the corner . " So what about the hunk ? " Babs asked , watching her over the rim of her cup . Amy 's blond brows went up .

" " This was differentand do n't tell me you did n't notice . " Oh , she 'd noticed all right . She could feel the heat in those dark eyes all the way across the room . It was what that hot look did to her that was startling . The Kitty Cat Club was filled with men every night . None of them made her stomach flip the way a single look from John Riggs had .

That the whole of the man 's meager fortune now rested at the bottom of the Atlantic did little to rouse Archer 's sympathy . On the contrary , it only ignited his fury . A red haze clouded Archer 's vision when he thought about what had been lost . Salvation had almost been his . Now it was gone because Hector Ellis 's pirates had raided Archer 's ship , stealing that which might cure him and hiding it away in their bloody doomed clipper ship . # Mud-thick fog hung low on the ground , refusing to drift off despite the crisp night breeze .

The constant clatter of coaches and the occasional shout of the night watch calling the hours had faded away . Darkness swallowed his form , as it always did , both a comfort and a reminder of what he 'd become . # The neighborhood around him was old but fine . Like all places that housed those whom fortune touched , the streets were empty and desolate , everyone having long ago tucked into their well-tufted beds. # Ellis 's house was near .

Archer took a cleansing breath and focused on the rage . # A garden lay ahead , large and walled in , its pleasures solely for the benefit of those who had the key . The seven-foot wall loomed up before him . It might as well be only four feet . He vaulted himself lightly up and over , landing on the soft grass below with nary a sound . # He rose , intent on his mission , when the sound of steel slicing against steel stopped him . Odd .

Not quite a man , his limbs held the lankiness of youth , but he was tall enough and the timbre of his voice had dropped . He was clearly the leader as he paced the other boy round the slate-lined court in the garden 's center . # " Keep your arm up , " he coached , coming at the younger boy again . # The younger boy was nearly as tall as his compatriot , but altogether delicate in form .

But his flesh his flesh remembered the pleasure of touch all too well . # Slowly , her slim hand smoothed over the swell of his buttock , lingering there . A shocked laugh choked his throat , the sound muddled by a stifled groan that her intrigued touch elicited . The saucy little sneak thief was copping a feel . He felt inclined to turn around and let her get a handful . Christ , this was madness . # Her breath came in hard rasps , audible and so like those of a woman being tupped that Archer 's head grew light , all available blood surging down to the throbbing pain in his cock . His forehead fell against the brick wall with a thud . Bits of mortar drifted like dust over his wrists as he clung to the wall like a buoy. # Inquisitive fingers combed his inner thigh , testing its hardness , and surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tight and hot it quivered . Sweet Christ . This time he could not bite back the low groan that filled him . It broke whatever spell she was under .

She stood gaping at him as if she could n't quite understand what had happened . A lovely rose tinted her cheeks , her fiery hair swirling in the cold wind . Already she was fading away , stepping back into the moonlight . The heat in him cooled , leaving him with a familiar hollowness just under his breastbone . His throat closed in on him . # " No weapons , " she whispered . # " No . " He clenched his fist to keep from reaching out . # " Well , thank you , then . " She backed up another step . " For speaking out . Unnecessary , but kind . " # " Wait . " # She halted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do . When she looked as though she might move , he fumbled with his pockets . Give her something . Make her stay . # " Here . " The coin in his hand flashed in the weak light as he held it out . " Take it . " # She did not hesitate . One second it was between his fingers , the other it was gone . He watched as she inspected it , the red wings of her brows knitting together . " West Moon Club ? " # " It is n't proper currency , " he said as the frown grew . " Just a silly trinket made by men who have nothing better to do with their time . I 've no use for it any longer .

" You think I 'm too proud to take it ? " # His lips twitched . " On the contrary . I think you pragmatic enough to make good use of it . " He did n't offer her the wad of bank notes he had in his pocket . A gift was one thing . Charity was another . # Green eyes slanted up at him . " Silver-tongued devil . But you 're wrong . I do n't take gifts from strangers . " # He opened his mouth to protest when she flicked her wrist .

The slim , black-enameled hilt was warm from her touch . That she trusted him with the knife left him oddly expectant , as if for once the next sunrise might be a welcome sight . " A trade it is , " he rasped. # " Go on , then , " she said . " I 'll not leave until you 're well out of here . " # Deliciously peremptory . His gut tightened and went hot . # Come with me . He 'd take her to a tavern , buy her ale and bread , tease her simply to hear her talk , to watch her all night and revel in the way she commanded those in orbit around her . Only then she 'd see him . And run . The heaviness in his chest was a crushing thing . # " As my lady wishes . " # She gave a start . She had n't truly thought he 'd obey , and it made him chuckle . God , he had n't smiled this much in years . The muscles along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he last laughed ? He could not remember . # Desperate yearning returned , for in her unflinching stare , the way she did not hesitate to speak to him , he saw the reflection of his own salvation . A man no longer cast out to the shadows , but seen . If there was a greater gift in this world he knew not of it . Archer was not fool enough to turn away from a gift . # Hector Ellis 's daughter . So the man would have to live . Archer turned a new plan over in his mind . One Archer knew Ellis would agree to , for a man such as him would agree to anything to save his own skin . A little time was all that Archer required . # Taking a deep breath , he made himself say the words he must . " Good night to you , fair Pan . " # Chapter One # Three years later . London , September 1881 # N o , no , farther down yes , that 's the one there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely . " # The man at the counter flushed in pleasure . His gaze strayed to her smiling lips and held for a moment past propriety . " The loveliest I 've seen , Miss . " # His small boldness sent another wash of red over his fair skin . Miranda leaned farther into him . The glass countertop beneath her elbows gave a small groan , and the clerk swallowed hard , his gaze flittering between her mouth and the swells of her breasts that plumped over her bodice . His grip tightened on the ruby bracelet he held in his hands . # So easy , really , to seduce a man with the simple act of arching one 's back . A woman ought to feel satisfaction in the sight . Miranda only felt as she always felt : dirty , wrong , empty . # " Set it down , " she murmured before clearing her throat delicately . " Let me see it in the proper light . " # Gently , he set the bracelet among the others , dozens of necklaces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wares pulled out for display than was prudent or proper . So very accommodating . And a mistake only a befuddled clerk would make . # Miranda set her chin upon her hand , the act bringing her arm against the side of her breast , lifting it further into view . The clerk smothered a noise , his eyes riveted to the sudden increase in displayed flesh . Her skin crawled . She did not flinch , only looked up at him with a small secret smile . You and I understand this forbidden desire between us , it said to him . Her free hand settled with the lightness of a feather upon the pearl necklace lying near her ribs . # " Any one of these jewels would do you credit , miss . " # Her finger hooked over the row of pearls . Slowly . Slowly . Countless times she had done this , yet every time felt like the first . Every time filled her with terror . Never let it show . # She mocked a wounded pout . " The jewels credit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he flushed . " You misunderstand . They pale against your beauty . Were I a ruby , I would despair at being noticed while in your presence . " # A genuine smile tugged at her lips . Plain and bashful , he might be , but the young man had a romantic heart and the beginnings of a poetic tongue . It was his whey-face and quick blushes that had made her select this shop that rested at the edge of respectability . The little shop specialized in fine jewels pawned by aristocrats whose wealth was dying . A place new wealth bought baubles for their town-kept mistresses . A place where a young , unescorted woman might go , pretend to shop for jewels far past her means so that she might flirt with the young clerk she had her eye on . # It was the role she played . Letting him see her walk by his window once a week . Making eye contact before turning away with a blush . And then working up her courage to finally enter . She dipped her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she murmured . # He fairly glowed with pleasure , and her heart ached . Too good a boy to ruin . For he would be ruined when his master found out what he had let happen here . But she could not return empty-handed . It had been too long . On the inside she screamed . This is my life , and I hate it . I hate it . She returned his smile . # The shop bell trilled , and the young man started as if caught with his hand in the biscuit bin . Two plump matrons entered , giving him a curt nod . Like Miranda 's , their gowns were slightly out of date and well-mended , but unlike with Miranda , the clerk took notice and did not jump to assist them . # Miranda trailed a gloved finger down her neck . # " W-would you like to try one of them on ? " he asked . # She licked her lower lip , a tiny flicker of pink tongue that kept him riveted . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her lips tremble . In truth , she felt like crying . # " Merciful heavens ! " # The matron 's exclamation made them both turn . The older woman pressed her hand upon her ample chest and grabbed hold of her companion . # " Oh , Jane , look who it is ! " # Her friend paled and made an attempt to support her friend . " Who , Margaret ? " # " The Dread Lord Archer ! His coach is coming up the street ! " # " No ! " # Both women craned their wrinkled necks to peek between the gold lettering upon the shop window . Miranda stopped short of rolling her eyes . What a pair , these two . Her fingers tensed to take her prize but she held firm . Slowly . Slowly . Marks always felt it if one rushed . It was instinctive . # " I 've seen him , " hissed Margaret . " Late one night on the way home from the theater . He walked along Piccadilly as if he had every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fright ! " # " You poor dear . What has the world come to when men such as he are permitted to roam the streets ? " # Miranda had never heard such censorious drivel. # " My dear , he is aristocracy , " said Margaret , " and as rich as Croesus . Who would dare question him ? I heard he has sent at least four men to hospital for simply looking at him in the wrong light . " # The conveyance came flush with the shop window . Miranda caught a glimpse of the black top hat and cloak of a coachman , a black coach with a white shield upon its door . # " Heavens , he looked at me " Jane shuddered , and with a moan , her eyes rolled up in her head . # " Jane ! " Her friend tried to grab her as the woman began to topple . # " Here ! Here ! " The clerk jumped up , running to catch the hare-brained woman . # There was something to say for flighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt pocket as she rushed to aid , accidentally brushing several necklaces off the counter in her haste . " Oh my , " she exclaimed , frantically trying to gather the jewels and succeeding in making a muck of it . Ropes of gold and gems fell to the floor , a hopeless muddle . # The clerk wavered between assisting her and struggling to help the matron on the floor . Perfect . # " What a mess I have made ! " Miranda pressed a shaking hand to her brow . " I am sorry . And you have your hands full ! " # She reached the door , her heart pounding . It pounded every time . Every time . # " Wait , Miss ! " The clerk buckled , his hand outstretched as if he would pull her back . # Hand twitching on the doorknob , she shot the clerk a regretful smile . " Good-bye . I am sorry . " # His words were drowned out by the bell . # Outside , the coach in question was gone , swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the gaping pedestrians begin moving on . Unsettled murmurs rippled along the streets before being drowned out by the usual clatter and clang of hacks , omnibuses , and coaches rattling along the cobbled road . Miranda decided she did not want to know what the unfortunate Lord Archer looked like . She had experienced enough horrors in her meager lifetime . # The slight weight in her pocket felt like a ton as she made her way home . Miranda 's steps stuttered to a stop as she saw the sleek , black double-brougham stretched out like a coffin in the front portico of the house . Thick whorls of yellow-green evening fog rose from the cobbled drive , ghosting over the coach 's large spoke wheels and coiling like snakes round the spindly legs of the matched black Friesians that stood placidly waiting . # Dread plucked at her insides . Long gone were the days when their drive filled with endless lines of landaus , barouches , and phaetons as nobility and gentry alike called upon father to purchase his wares . # With a jostle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and the crest upon the door flashed in the waning light . A white shield bisected by a heavy black cross bore the words Sola bona quae honesta upon it . Four sharp arrowheads slashed across the white planes of the shield . The hairs along her arm stood at attention , and she knew the source of her disquiet . The Dread Lord Archer . # The coach drew near , and the form of a figure , no more than a broad black outline of shoulders and the glimpse of an arm , appeared behind the window glass . As the coach pulled away , a finger of ice slid along Miranda 's spine , for someone was staring back . # " I shall not ! " # Her shout bounded off the bare stone walls of the dark , cramped kitchen . High and rather thready , nothing like Miranda 's normal voice . She struggled to tone it down . # Her father moved around the battered wooden table that stood between them . His small brown eyes flashed . " You most certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My word is law here ! " # " Bosh . " She slammed her wooden spoon down as well , sending a splatter of mutton stew across the pudding . " Your control over me ended the day you sold Daisy off to the highest bidder . " # The wrinkled mask of his face went pale as Irish linen . " You dare ! " His hand rose to strike but held , hovering in the air and shaking , when she did not flinch. # " Please try it , " she said quietly . Her eyes held his as the air about her began to coalesce , heating and stirring with an almost expectant agitation . " I beg of you . " # Father 's hand quivered then slowly lowered . " I 'm sure you do , daughter . " Spittle slicked the corners of his shaking lips . " See me writhe and burn . " # Miranda shifted , heat and pain mingling within her belly , a surge that wanted out . # " Always calling upon the fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes burning into her . " Never mind the price . " # Like a flame in a draft , the heat snuffed , and with it , her father 's confidence seemed to swell . # " The worst of it is that I do this for you , " he coaxed , leaning in . " You 're not a lass anymore . Not for years . Did you think to live here forever with me ? " # " No , I " Her mouth snapped shut . She had not given the future much thought but simply lived from day to day . Surviving . No point exchanging the hell one knew for the hell one did not . # " I think you must believe so . You 've scared off every lad that 's come this way ever since that fool Martin " He swallowed down his words aware , for once , that even he might have gone too far . But he rallied quickly , and his bushy brows formed a white V. " It can not have escaped your notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His weathered hand swept over the meager meal of mutton stew and simple brown bread pudding that Miranda was preparing . " Who do you think provided the money for this meal ? " # " I thought perhaps you 'd sold the wool " # His dry cackle cut the air . " With the price of wool being as low as it is , and the debts I owe , we 'd be lucky to dine on fish-head stew . My creditors will take the house before the year is out , " he said quietly . " And you will have no home to come to . " # A home ? She almost laughed . She had n't a true home in years . Not since her sisters had left . # " Does n't take much to imagine what trade a beauty like you will find , " he went on . " But once that beauty fades ? ' T is hardly fittin ' to say what 's to come of you . " # " Oh , stop ! " Miranda snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And one that 's hung over my head for years . " # " Bloody hell ! " The pudding crashed to the floor in a mess of brown scum and broken crockery . " You owe me , Miranda ! " Rage colored him red as he pointed at her . " If it were n't for that fire , I 'd have half my fortune ! By God , you destroyed my bloody warehouse ! " # " Years I have paid penance for my mistake ! " she shouted . " Still , it is not enough . Well , I am done with it . " Her hand slashed the air as if the motion could somehow sever their conversation . " You can not make me do this ! " # Father 's thin lip curled into a sneer . " Aye , I can not , " he agreed with sudden calmness . " The agreement states you must go willingly , or it is void . " He took a step closer , pressing up against the wooden table , and pointed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : Should you refuse , you 'll no longer live here . " # Her throat closed , red-hot pain forming a large lump there . The lack of a home was one thing . The lack of proper shelter was another beast entirely . " You can not seriously " She swallowed . # The yellowed whites of his eyes flashed in the lamplight . " I 'm done with you . I would not have kept you as long as I have if I were n't waiting for this moment . So you 've had a disappointment with Martin . I 'm glad for it ! I was a fool to even consider it . Some promises are too dangerous " He swallowed audibly . " Your bags are packed , either way , " he snapped . # So it had come to this . Miranda 's lower lip quivered before she bit down hard . There was little love lost between them . But he was her father , and he was prepared to toss her to the wolves . Pain radiated across her chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . Dead . She knew that look . His decision was made . Even so , she could not but try . # " I can not believe you would " # " You will marry Lord Archer ! " he shouted out , his temper breaking like glass . " Devil take it , the man is one of the richest nobles in the kingdom . I can not believe your stupidity for even refusing . Of all the bleeding stubborn " # " But why ? " A wretched sob escaped before she could swallow it down . Hateful that she should be weak before him . # He stopped short and blinked at her . " Why what ? " # " Why does he want me ? " She wiped a hand over her mouth . " I am nobody . I 've never heard of the man before today . How can he know me ? " # Father 's expression froze for a long moment before he broke into an incredulous laugh . " I may be a failed man , Miranda Rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He came round the table , his expression almost fond . She backed away from him , bumping up against the worktable . Father stopped but the satisfaction in his smile remained . # " Lord Archer has wealth , power , and land . A man such as that need not look to nobility for a bride . Overbreeding has left their rank chinless and small-eyed . You , my dear , are a diamond in a sea of cut glass . " A familiar gleam lit Father 's eyes , the glint of a transaction well played . " The finest feather for his cap . " # For a moment , she saw red . " I will go to Poppy or Daisy . " # A terrible silence fell between them , and her father 's confident expression withered . He went pale as cream . " They wo n't want you . Never have . " # " They 've offered before . " Her sisters had pleaded with her , in truth . And she had refused out of a misplaced sense of obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the one to start him on the road to ruin . How gratifying to know that she had finally reached her limit on guilt . But she did n't want her sisters ' pity , nor to be their burden . The very idea made her insides pitch . # Father raised his hands in disgust . " He has paid handsomely for the right to you , Miranda . If you plan to forfeit the agreement , then I am leaving . " He straightened his tattered waistcoat and smoothed his disheveled hair . " I suggest you do the same . Believe me when I say that Lord Archer does not take kindly to being cheated . " # " Oh , I believe you . " Something told her his being cheated by Father had put her into this mess in the first place . # They stared at each other for a long minute , her finger tapping an idle rhythm against the counter while her father waited in stony silence . She ought to hate this Lord Archer for buying her like a commodity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman in England did . Marriage was a business . Any sensible girl knew this . It was only when they had come down in the world that she 'd started to hope she might marry for love . # The stew bubbled brown and thick in the pot next to her , making her stomach growl . She missed having steady meals , a life free of theft and guilt . A wash of shame hit her so suddenly that she sucked in a pained breath . Lord Archer had entered into an agreement in good faith . Only to become another man her father would cheat , and she 'd be a part of it . # No more . She would not become like Father . She could live a life of honor and walk with her head held up from now on . # Faced with the choice of living on the streets or doing the honorable thing , her decision was rather easy . Unfortunately , that did not stop her stomach from turning over as she forced the words from her mouth . # " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matron in a swoon flashed in her mind , and a moment of pure terror wracked her body . She swallowed hard . " All right . I will do it . " # He gaped at her , unbelieving . When she simply stared back , a smile pulled at his mouth . " Very good . " Satisfied , Father grabbed a thick slice of bread off the counter . " On the morrow , then . " # Her head snapped back . " What ! " # He half-turned , his mouth already full . " He insists upon marrying you tomorrow , " he said around the bread . " Everything has been arranged . Lord Archer has already acquired a special license so there is no impediment or need to wait . " # The fire beneath the burners flared high for an instant . Her life had been bought , sold , and arranged quite neatly . Bloody men . # Her father tore off another hunk with his teeth and turned to go . # " Stop ! " Miranda reached deep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " The pearl choker slammed to the table . " And treasure it well , for it is the last thing I shall ever steal for you . We are more than even now , Father . After this , we are finished . " # Chapter Two # G etting married was a happy dream that had filled Miranda 's girlhood thoughts and promptly left as she grew older . She well knew the face that looked back from the mirror each morning . She was not foolish enough to pretend that she was without beauty . Vanity may be a sin but so was lying . She was fair of face and form , though she knew many a girl who looked better . # However , as a woman without fortune or title , she received few offers of marriage . The most consistent offers came in the form of teasing shouts from market vendors when she walked to Covent Garden each Saturday morning . How then , she thought as Daisy pinned white roses in her hair the following morning , had it come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the mirror did n't look at all like her . She was too pale . Her pink gown , one of many provided by Lord Archer 's money , ruffled and frothed around her like a confectionary . Miranda turned away with disdain . It was the image of an innocent and a maiden . She was neither . And yet he had come for her . Why ? # She did not believe Father 's nonsense about him wanting her for her beauty . There were plenty of pretty daughters of utterly bankrupt , thus desperate , nobles for a wealthy man to chose from . What , then , did he want ? What has the world come to when men such as he are permitted to roam the streets Perspiration bloomed along her upper lip . And yet Lord Archer did not know precisely what he was acquiring when he took Miranda as his bride , did he ? # To create fire by mere thought . It was the stuff of myth . She had discovered the talent quite by accident . And had burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden anyone to ever speak of it and , more to the point , for Miranda to ever use her talent again . Poppy had simply disappeared in the library to search for an explanation ; she never found one . Only Daisy had been impressed , though quite put out that she did not possess a similar unearthly talent . As for herself , the question always remained : Was she a monster ? Both beauty and beast rolled into one unstable force ? Despite her desire to know , there was the greater fear of putting the question to anyone and seeing them turn away as Martin had . So she kept it inside . She would not tell her husband to be , no . But she took comfort in the notion that she was not without defenses. # Poppy and Daisy 's mutual disregard for Father kept them at a distance as Father hovered by her elbow , guarding all possible attempts to escape . Their chatter was no more than a din , Father 's hand upon her arm a ghost , as they made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Reverend Spradling met them at the door . The brackets around his fleshy mouth cut deep as his eyes slid from Miranda to Father . " Lord Archer is " He tilted his head and pulled at the cassock hugging his bulging neck . " He is waiting in the vestry . " # " Grand , " said Father with an inane smile . # " He wants to talk to Miss Ellis in private , " the reverend interrupted as Father tried to walk through the doorway . " I told him it was inappropriate but he was most insistent . " # The two men turned to Miranda . So now her opinion mattered , did it ? She might have laughed , only she feared it would come out as a sob . # " Very well . " She gathered her skirts . Her fingers had turned to ice long before , and the ruffles slid from her grasp . She took a firmer hold . " I wo n't be but a moment . " # Slowly , she walked toward the vestry door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would be her husband , the man who sent brutes to hospital and caused women to swoon with terror . # He stood erect as a soldier at the far end of the little stone room . Women , she thought , letting her gaze sweep over him , could be utterly ridiculous . # She closed the door and waited for him to speak . # " You came . " He could not fully stamp out the surprise in his deep voice . # " Yes . " # He was tall and very large , though there was n't a spare ounce of fat discernible over his entire form . The largeness of appearance came from the breadth of his shoulders , the muscles that his charcoal gray morning suitno matter how finely tailoredcould not completely hide and the long length of his strong legs encased in gray woolen trousers . It was not the elegant , thin frame of a refined man , but the brute and efficient form of a dockworker . In short , Lord Archer possessed the sort of virile body that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for one unavoidable fact . # She lifted her eyes to his face , or where it ought to be . Carved with a Mona Lisa smile upon its lips , a black hard mask like one might wear at Carnival stared back . Beneath the mask , his entire head was covered in tight black silk , offering not a bit of skin to view . The perversity of his costume unnerved , but she was hardly willing to swoon . # " I thought it best , " he said after letting her study him , " that you enter into this union with full understanding . " Black-gloved fingers ran over the silver handle of the walking stick he held . " As you are to be my wife , it would be foolish of me to try to keep my appearance from you . " # He spoke with such equanimity that she could only gaze in amazement . A memory flickered before her eyes like a flame caught in a draft , a vision of a different man , in a different place . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had haunted her dreams for months afterward , made her want things she had n't the name for back then , things that made her skin heat on many a cold night . It had shamed her , the way she had coveted the dark stranger . But it could not have been Lord Archer . The stranger had a voice like shadows , rasping and weak , not like Lord Archer 's strong , deep rumble. # " Look sharp , Miss Ellis ! " The walking stick slammed on the stone floor with a crack , and she jumped . " Do you still intend to proceed ? " he asked with more calm . # She stepped forward , and the man went rigid . " Who are you ? An actor of some sort ? " Her temper swelled like fire to air . " Is this some joke Father has concocted to bedevil me , because let me tell you " # " I am Lord Benjamin Archer , " he said with such acidity that she halted . His eyes flashed from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The hand on the walking stick tightened . " Though there are days I wish it to be just that . " # " Why do you wear that mask ?

" # The immobile black mask simply stared back , floating like a terrible effigy over broad shoulders . # " What is beauty or ugliness but a false front that prompts man to make assumptions rather than delving deeper . Look at you . " His hand gestured toward her face . " Not a flaw or distortion of line to mar that perfect beauty . I have seen your face before , miss . Michelangelo sculpted it from cold marble three hundred years ago , his divine hand creating what men would adore . " He took a step closer . " Tell me , Miss Ellis , do you not use that beauty as a shield , keeping the world at bay so that no one will know your true nature ? " # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice . She had been beaten once or twice , forced to steal and lie , but no one had left her so utterly raw . # " I am that as well . Better you know it now . " # She gathered up her train , but the heavy masses of slippery fabric evaded her grip . " I came of my own free will but will not abide by cruel remarks made at my expense , " she said , finally collecting herself . " Good-bye , Lord Archer . " # He moved , but stopped himself as though he feared coming too close . A small gurgle died in his throat . " What will it take ? " # The tightly controlled urgency in his voice made her turn back . # " If you find my character and appearance so very distasteful , " she said through her teeth , " then why ask for my hand ?

" # It irked her that his words made her chest tighten in regret . # Lord Archer tilted his head and assessed her with all the warmth of a man eyeing horseflesh for purchase . " Your appearance may matter little to me but when the time comes for my heir to enter into society , your stunning looks will help a great deal to facilitate him .

This is between us now . Whatever your decision , your father may keep what little funds he has n't managed to squander without fear of retribution from me. " # " And if I say no ? What will you do ?

In short , I need you . Your help , that is . Should you grant it , Miss Ellis , you shall want for nothing . " # The man in the black mask seemed to stand alone , apart from everything . Miranda knew loneliness when she saw it . Her mind drifted over another memory , one hard repressed . One of herself standing in the very same corner of the vestry , watching as Martin cut their engagement and walked away . And it had hurt . God , it had hurt . So much so that the idea of doing it to another made her queasy . # Lord Archer had shown his weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd given her power over him .

Foolish was the woman who gave away her freedom out of sympathy . No , it was not sympathy or the hope of power that prompted a decision ; she felt something when in the presence of this strange man , a tingling thrill that played over her belly , the sense of rapid forward motion though her body stood still . It was a feeling long dormant , one gleaned from taking a sword in hand , swaggering through dark alleys when all proper girls were in their beds . It was adventure . Lord Archer , with his black countenance and rich voice , offered a sense of adventure , a dare . She could do nothing short of picking up that gauntlet , or regret it for the rest of her days . Perhaps , then , she could help them both . The idea of helping rather than destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda collected the blasted train that threatened to trip her and straightened . " We have kept my father and sisters waiting long enough , Lord Archer . " She paused at the door to wait for him . " Shall we go ? " # Chapter Three # I t had been a brief ceremony , without sentiment . A few words spoken , and Miranda Rose Ellis had disappeared . She glanced down at her wedding ring , a glowing round moonstone held aloft by a thin gold band . Now , as Lady Miranda Archer , she rode in an elegant town coach opposite her new husband . A cantankerous grumble of thunder sounded overhead and , with it , a flash of blue light . Lord Archer 's black mask gleamed for an instant , the high curves of its cheekbones and the rounded eye sockets highlighted in the dim . Miranda 's heart missed a beat . # Silver streaks of rain slid down the window , obscuring the view as they crossed a small gully . She leaned closer only to have the window fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away , heedless of marring her kid gloves , and was rewarded with the sight of her new home as they turned up the long drive . # Rising up four stories , it broke from the gentle crest of land like the crags of a mountaintop . Lightning flashed above the rain-slicked slate roof , bringing the sharp gables and multiple chimneys into fine relief against the rolling sky . # Her palm flattened against the icy window . The Gothic-styled house was almost as wide as it was high . It dominated the land , lording like a great hulking beast . Large bow windows gleamed like pale jewels in a crown , but showed nothing of light or life within . Only a small lonely little light over the front portico guided the way home . # The coach shuddered to a halt , and the steady drum of the rain upon the roof abated . Lord Archer stepped swiftly from the cab and promptly took hold of her elbow . She bit the inside of her cheek and stood straight as she climbed the cold marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the portico , and the brass lantern hanging high above swayed . Behind them , the four blacks stood placidly , rain dripping from their shaggy manes , steam escaping in bursts from their nostrils as they waited for the outrider to take down Miranda 's traveling valise. # A not-so-gentle squeeze upon Miranda 's arm made her turn around . No , she could not run to the safety of the coach . Enormous black double doors loomed high before opening to reveal the figure of an elderly man outlined in pale lamplight . More gloom . # They walked through the doors and into light . And warmth . A large hall opened up before them , the sight making her falter . Easily the width and breadth of her old home , the hallway was filled , not with cobwebs and dank wood as she had imagined , but light and beauty . White-and-black marble floors laid out in a checkerboard design shined beneath her heels . The woodwork was painted crisp white , and the walls covered in black lacquer . Such a color ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet under the light of crystal sconces and an elegant chandelier of cut crystal and golden filigree . Russian , she thought , looking up at it ; nothing that beautifully crafted could be anything but . # Lord Archer watched her appraisal . " You were expecting something different ? " # " I yes , " she admitted . " The house appeared so foreboding when we came up the drive . " # " We arrived during a storm . " A sudden moan of wind from the other side of the doors punctuated his statement . " Very few houses appear hospitable in such conditions , especially if they are unfamiliar . " # " That is true . " # " But you still expected something different , " he said , studying her as though she were a specimen under a microscope . # How he knew the truth , she could not comprehend . Long before the storm , her wild imaginings had pictured dark corridors , gloomy rooms , and dusty halls laced with cobwebs. # His penetrating stare did not abate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it comfortable ? " # " Of course . " Desperately , she looked to the elderly gentleman who stood as straight as a mainmast not two feet away . He 'd taken Lord Archer 's coat and hat when they entered , and had done so with such quiet efficiency Miranda doubted Lord Archer had truly noticed him . # Lord Archer caught the direction of her gaze and stiffened . " Hullo , Gilroy . Did n't see you there . You have everything prepared ? " # " Good evening , my lord . Yes , my lord . " # Around a network of wrinkles , Gilroy 's kind eyes gleamed deep brown . Miranda nodded in greeting as Lord Archer took the mantle from her shoulders . " This is Lady Archer . " He handed Gilroy the mantle . # " Gilroy is our butler , majordomo , what have you , " he said to her as though the idea of titles irritated him a little . # " I am honored , my lady . " The man gave a short bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor to serve you well . " # " I am confident you will , " she said , reaching for the same quiet dignity . The idea that she had a staff was almost enough to send her running to the carriage . Only Lord Archer would assuredly haul her back . # Lord Archer took her elbow once more and they walked down the length of the hall , past artworks of pastoral scenes and portraits of bewigged ladies and gentlemen . # " Do you have a valet ? " Miranda asked , turning back toward Lord Archer as they moved past a small front parlor done up in lemon yellow and white with delicate Grecian style furnishings . # " No . I am a grown man , well capable of dressing and shaving myself . Gilroy takes care of incidentals . " He waved his hand in distraction . # Poor Gilroy . # Lord Archer 's eyes cut to her as though hearing the silent criticism . " It is n't as though I have lacings and coiffures to worry over , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One never speaks of personal grooming . A gentleman should never mention a lady 's toilette . Then again , Miranda had found Mother 's lectures rather stifling . " I admit surprise , " she said , catching a glimpse of a library filled with blue velvet sofas and deep leather wing chairs . " I 've always thought nobles considered a valet a mark of distinction . Father said if you could , your lot would have someone wipe your " She trailed off in a furious flush of heat . # Lord Archer looked at her sidelong . " Do go on , Lady Archer . " # She stepped away to peer into a large room of powder blue , rather hoping that the floor would open up and swallow her whole . What had prompted her to speak so basely ? She had deliberately tried to bait Lord Archer . # " The ladies ' salon , " he murmured as she gazed up at the ceiling painted like a summer sky with rolling clouds and sunbeams . The dcor of the home was old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , no wall coverings of ornate patterning , no doilies , needlework , or bric-a-brac to fill the space . White lintels , Grecian pediments over the doors , their dentil moldings foiled with gold . Marble busts and convex mirrors adorned the simple mantels . Gothic architecture , Georgian interior , Regency dcor it was like sinking slowly back in a time long past . # " I shall give you a proper tour tomorrow . " He headed toward a massive staircase of white marble . " For now , you need rest . " # Miranda could wander through a house such as this all day . But she let herself be led , her feet sinking soundlessly into the carpet when they reached the second floor . # The walls were crimson . Golden candle-fed sconces and potted palms made the long hallway cheery , but the absence of servants was odd . " Where are the other servants ? " she whispered . It would surely take an army of them to keep such a house . # " I keep a small staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them tomorrow . " # Feeling lost , she reached out and touched his arm . He pulled away with a low hiss , and her face flamed . " I 'm sorry . " She chided herself for touching him , for feeling the need to . # Lord Archer took a long breath . " No . I am . " He cursed sharply . " The accident my right side . I do n't like to be touched on my right side . " He stilled and then lifted his left arm , offering it to her . " I have offended you , the very thought of which shames me . Take my left arm . It is unaffected . Please , " he added when she hesitated . # His eyes were gray , a true dove gray surrounded by thick black lashes that rivaled any lady 's . It seemed an odd thing to fixate upon but she could not look away . Her heart tapped like a metronome , the palpable thing that was the force of his will and the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand upon his arm , noting the hardness of it and the way his muscles jumped at her touch . # Her husband nodded in satisfaction , then pulled her along . He stopped before a set of doors where an elderly woman waited . # " This is Eula , our housekeeper , " he said by way of introduction . " You shall want to discuss the household running with her , I should think . " # By the way the elder woman was glaring at her , Miranda had grave doubts as to their working together . # Lord Archer stood stiffly between the women . " Well then , I shall see you at dinner . " He gave an awkward bow to Miranda and left her alone with the scowling woman . # Coming only to Miranda 's shoulder , the thin woman held herself stiffly erect and set her eagle eyes upon her . Miranda stared back squarely as the hairs on the nape of her neck bristled . The woman 's bedraggled bun was the color of old ivory . The lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the skin were strong . Something she saw in Miranda must have met her approval . One corner of her colorless lips lifted slightly . # " Well , you 're no mouse . Thank God for that . A mouse has no business coming into a lion 's den . " Her gray brow lifted when Miranda merely held her stare . " Come along then . His Worship has bid me leave you a luncheon . I suppose a skinny bird such as yourself will be wanting some food . " # Over Eula 's shoulder , Miranda spied a tureen of soup and a mound of golden rolls spilling from a ceramic basket . Her stomach almost growled in anticipation . # Eula turned to shuffle into Miranda 's room , leaving in her wake the smell of camphor and old sheets . " He 'll collect you himself come dinner , " she said over her shoulder . " And do n't think of leaving these rooms by yourself . " # " And why not ? " Really , Miranda had no intention of wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The dark hides all manner of sins here . No telling what horrors you 'll encounter in some shadowed corner . " # Eula 's discordant cackle taunted Miranda as the woman disappeared down the hall . Heart thumping in her chest , Miranda sat heavily on a plush settee . This was not a mistake . The evil woman only sought to scare her . Miranda bit her lip as she stared at the empty doorway , for one thought bothered her above all others : She wished Lord Archer would come back . # Chapter Four # A rcher nearly ran down the hall like a frightened schoolboy . Had he some blasted malady that prompted him to act the ass at the very worst instant ? Surely he must , for he 'd nearly lost her before even having her . He cursed and shoved open the servant 's door . A maid coming up the stairs squeaked in alarm , nearly dropping her pile of linens . Sally , was it ? New maid . She 'd learn . # He took the narrow stairs upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well prepared for the sudden sight of the master on the backstairs . Archer took the stairs two at a time , tugging at his cravat as he got toward the top . # He burst through the door at the top of the stair and slammed it behind him , setting the panes of glass above his head shuddering . Solitude . Already he felt his disquiet ebb . # His green house . A little glass jewel hidden away on the roof of the house . The rain rattled hard upon the glass , streaking and pebbling , hiding the world from view . It was kinder here , warm and humid . Filled with potted fruit trees and velvet roses , their fresh scent as thick as the air . # The mask first . He tore it from his head , then the inner one , and allowed himself the first fresh breath he 'd had in hours . The humid air collided with his sweat-soaked skin , and his nerves twitched . He raked his fingers hard through his flattened hair , scraping his scalp just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of his clothes followed in rapid succession . Then he moved to the water tap set high in the wall and opened it . # God it was cold . Good . He needed as much . Being trapped in the dammed coach with her had been torture enough . Archer closed his eyes and let the water pour over his head , down his heated torso . And he was rewarded with the image of that blasted reverend looking at him in the church , waiting for him to kiss Mirandaof all things . Had the man any idea of just how badly Archer had wanted to ? # And her voice . It no longer held that high , girlish pip , but was warm and softlike honey in the sun . Archer shivered . That voice , haunting him for three years . He took a shuddering breath , closed the tap , and reached for a towel . # The rain petered out to a light mist as he walked to the long cot by one of the glass walls . He reclined on it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses in full , audacious bloom . This was n't how he 'd imagined facing her , still trapped in a mask , snapping at her like an arrogant bastard solely because , for the first time in years , he 'd felt true embarrassment over his appearance . What must she think of him ? # His forearm fell over his eyes . Ah God , and that utter rot about wanting her for an heir . Right-ho , when he could n't even show her who he was . What he was . His mind had gone blank when she 'd asked him for an explanation . The truth was ridiculous , and the height of selfishness . Because he wanted her , despite all logic , all caution . Though he could never fully be with her , he needed her near . And now ? Being near her was n't nearly enough . # How could he hide what he was from her indefinitely ? His desolate laugh sounded like a stranger 's . Impossible . What he wanted was impossible . # Not impossible . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in his head . " Ah , Elizabeth . If only it were you . " # It was a game he played with himself , talking to her as though she were here . Sometimes he wondered if talking with a memory was the final push into madness . Or the only thing that kept him sane . # You deserve happiness , Benjamin . # It was what he wanted to hear . But was it true ? # A teardrop of dew rolled along the velvet edge of a rose . It hung for a suspended moment , glimmering diamond bright , before falling on his temple to skim over his brow like the stroke of a fingertip . He could n't remember the last time human hands had willingly touched him . # Not true . Miranda had . She had touched him as if he were just a man . He had lived on those moments ever since , pulled them to the fore when loneliness threatened to suck him down and drown him . He had n't meant to be away from her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drifted into three . # He took a deep breath . The air around was still , wet , and thick . Past the sweetness of roses came the heady scents of exotic orchids , strange plants acquired on his trips down the Amazon . All in search of a cure . His gaze drifted to the cluster of fire-pink flowers resembling a feather duster . That one had turned his piss red for a week . The purple seeds from some dark pit in Brazil that would have killed a normal man had him hunched over begging for mercy for twenty-four hellish hours . So many experiments . Trips to forgotten places . Strange concoctions made by tribal medicine men . Failures all . But he had been close . # Daoud , his valet , his trusted ally , had found it . The man 's clear script burned bright in Archer 's memory . # My lord , our suspicions prove correct . Alexandria held the key . I have found the answer . To be conveyed in the agreed-upon venue . # And so Archer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent out on his fastest vessel , The Karina , only to be set upon by Hector Ellis 's pirates and lost to the sea . Two days later , Daoud 's body was found , his throat slit , silenced forever . Archer 's return trip to Egypt to discover what Daoud might have found yielded nothing . # Frustration made him want to crawl out of his skin . " Damn it all , " he hissed . # Elizabeth 's voice filled his mind . You have her now . All will be well . # " Now who sounds hopeful ? " he said , blinking up at the glass roof . But there was hope . His sources told him his box might not have sunk to the bottom of the sea , but made it to England . Thus he had returned , and had been unable to keep from claiming his bride . # Sunlight broke through the gray clouds . Shafts of light hit the glass house and filled it up . And when the first rays touched him , a familiar tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once feeling the surge , the heatand the bitter failurefor he had not been able to stay away from the light . His body hummed , the light pouring through him . God help him , he was weak . He thought of Miranda , and his fist curled tight . He needed to be stronger . For her . # Then get back down there and be with her , coward . # For a moment he thought he heard gentle laughter . Then it was silent . # Chapter Five # S ir Percival Andrew , Second Baronet of Doddington , old as he was , had certain rituals preceding his afternoon nap . First , a kiss from his wife , Beatrice , who then drew the heavy brocade drapes closed and helped him don a dressing gown before retiring for a nap of her own . Marks , his valet , might have attended him but , as Bea often teased , his kiss was not half as sweet . # The second , a glass of port to be imbibed while sitting in his favorite chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled down with a satisfied sigh , his old bones aching yet comforted by the warm hearth , and picked up the morning edition of the Times . The fire popped , and the paper rattled in the quiet . A peaceful moment shattered as a shout of pure incredulity broke from his lips upon reading the wedding announcement of Lord Benjamin Aldo Fitzwilliam Wallace Archer , Fifth Baron Archer of Umberslade , to Miss Miranda Rose Ellis . # " Son of a bitch ! " He slammed the paper down in a rare display of temper . That bastard . Returning to England when he had promised to stay away . After all the work Percival had done to hush things up , the countless times he had covered Archer 's tracks , for the sake of all their reputations . Now in jeopardy because Archer had a twitch in his cock . Impertinent lot , the Archers . One and all . By God , it was not to be borne . The impudent whelp would have to be spoken to , firmly . # A cold wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . The oddity of it barely touched his mind before an arm slammed around his chest , pinning him to the chair . Heart in his mouth , he caught the sight of a black mask at the corner of his eye . # " Archer ? " he rasped . Blood thundered through his ears . His bladder had let loose , the thick briny smell cutting through the cold air as the warmth seeped over his skin . # " Forgive me , " said a familiar voice that caused Percival to convulse against the chair . " But I need you to send a message . " # Steel flashed white in the soft light . A sharp burn shot across Percival 's throat . He gagged , hot blood splashing his shaking hands , splattering across the white marble mantle and the faded daguerreotype of Bea on her fortieth birthday . He took a rattling breath , tasted salt and blood upon his tongue . Bea . # " Are you well settled ? " Lord Archer led Miranda to a table long enough to seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mirror-paneled table was laden with food enough for a party . The sight of numerous silver-domed serving dishes perplexed her as the table was set for one . A single , lonely place setting next to the head of the table . # He held out the chair in front of the setting and bid her to sit . # " Yes , thank you . " She eyed the food with amazement as he proceeded to lift the lids himself . Wafts of steam rose from the dishes and , with it , the scent of rich warm food , too much to distinguish any one component but rather a miasma of such delectability that her mouth watered . " You are not eating ? " # " Alas , I can not dine with you , " he said with a touch of asperity , for the reason was obvious . " I dined earlier . " # She glanced away from the mask , wondering with chagrin if they were ever to dine together . " Then all of this bounty is for my benefit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure of eating such foods for some time . " He reached for her soup bowl . " Oyster stew or chicken soup ? " # " Oyster , please . " A happy smile pulled her lips . She had n't had oyster stew in years . # Lord Archer ladled the fragrant white broth into the bowl and set it down . " Whereas I have been blessed with endless bounty , yet no one with whom to share it , " he finished , handing her a small silver bowl filled with oyster crackers . # " But I could not eat all of this . " # " Well , I certainly hope you shall try a little . Careful consideration has gone into the planning of this meal , " he said lightly . " I shall be thoroughly put out should you waste away from lack of effort . " # " Wish to fatten me up , do you ? " # " Mmm . " Gray eyes skimmed over her form . " How does the fairy tale go ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I have lured you into my luscious house of candy and gingerbread to tempt you with sugared delights . And when you are nice and plump , I shall gobble you up . " # A flush of tangible heat washed like the tide over her skin . There was only light laughter in his tone yet the force of his gaze made her turn away . Stomach fluttering , she tried to look stern . " I suppose you have forgotten that Gretel outwitted the old witch in the end and roasted her alive . " # He chuckled , a deep rumbling of thunder before a storm . " How very gruesome . " # " Yes , quite , " Miranda agreed with a smile . Ah , but he was charming . Unexpected , but decidedly so . " Very well , I shall do my part . Only what of the rest ? " # " The servants shall have it . " He looked at her with some amusement . " Does that appease you ? " # " It does . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden puddles of butter , tasted like heaven on a spoon . She nearly groaned with pleasure and forced herself to eat slowly , aware that Lord Archer watched with rapt interest . # " Wine ? " He poured with the deft ease of a seasoned servant . # " Is this how we shall normally dine ? " The service was like nothing she 'd seen before . While resembling a familiar meal served a la franaise , there were no removes . Everything was simply on the table , including a large platter of fruit , overflowing with velvety figs , glossy pears , and crisp apples , cut open and saturated with rich color . # " No . " A touch of humor lifted his voice as his eyes continued their watch . " Call this " his hand waved toward the table " a bit of fancy on my part . I wanted you to have a wedding feast of sorts . " # She lowered her wineglass , her gaze catching his , and a strange sensation of longing rushed through her . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toyed with a silver salt cellar with his long , be-gloved fingers . A footman entered as if by magic , whisked away her bowl , and left while Lord Archer lifted more lids . # " We need n't stand on ceremony , " he said . " I 've never understood why one must have soup , then fish , then fowl or meat . " # She had to laugh . " Or food that is n't too highly spiced . At least not for ladies . " # He laughed as well . " Indeed . And all very properly served . Why not eat what we want when we want ? " He took her plate . " Although , now that I 've had a look , might I suggest the sole ? My cook is quite gifted , I have to say . " # " Yes , please . " # " Food is the one thing I did not miss when I was away from England . " He handed her the plate and sat . " I should think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper English dinner any time soon . " # " Is our cuisine really so awful ? " # " When you 've sampled what the rest of the world has to offer , yes . Although we do breakfast spectacularly well . " # Miranda glanced at her husband . A person 's skin , she realized just then , was an indispensable clue as to one 's true age . As Lord Archer 's attire revealed none of his , she could only guess at his age . His voice was of no help ; rich and rumbling , it could belong to a man aged twenty-five to sixty . Her eyes trailed over the lean , muscular body of a man in his prime . With such a physique , he could not be older than forty-five . But the quick , light way in which he moved gave the impression of youth . In his thirties , perhaps ? It must be so , as he was too much in command of himself to be a man in his early twenties . # " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # He sat back , resting one arm on his chair .

If it had n't been for him , we 'd still be wearing queues down our backs to show subservience to the Manchus who ran China at the time . # But tragically , Sun died prematurely and the KMT and the Communists stopped working together . After the bloody split , Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung rose to power in the KMT and Chinese Communist Party , and there was little for the average Chinese person to do for more than two decades but fight , suffer , and die . # I put away the pro-KMT paper and flipped open the pro-Communist one .

@@4161917 Here one must leave behind all hesitation ; Here every cowardice must meet its death . Inferno His hands quivered ever so slightly . Not with fearhe scoffed silently at the very notionbut with the exhilaration thrumming through his veins . His moment of triumph , of victorious possession , came upon him and he would not deny its power . Battista della Palla stood before the carved door , shoulders hunched , broad body curled inward , as he jimmied the miniscule , well-worn silver rod into the small , square lock well . Dark eyes stole a quick , sidelong glance down each end of the empty corridor . A few flicks of his leather-cuffed wrist and ... click . He hummed a contented sigh , pushed back the swath of wavy black hair from his face , and pushed over the arched swing shackle of the padlock . The heavy , intricately scrolled device dropped into his hands and he palmed it into his satchel ; such locks were a treasure worth filching . For Battista , their value lay far beyond the monetary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last glance to the empty passageway , a waggle of dark , thick brows , and a twitch of a smile , he took a bow to an imaginary audience and slipped in . Stepping into the largest private room of the palazzo , he tucked his small tool back into its pouch on his cuff . One lone candle burned low in the far corner , its pale yellow light outshone by that of the three-quarter moon . The gray glow streamed through the four tall leaded windows on the opposite wall , checkering the room with squares of muted incandescence . He had seen the inside of many a nobleman 's bedchamber , spent more than a little time in them , for here the privileged kept their valuables . Here Battista did much of his work . The fire burned low in the grate to his left , meek blaze sparking upon the gold cloth of the pastoral tapestries covering the inside wall beside him . There , in front of him , at the foot of the curtained bed , stood the mahogany strongbox , rugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowing cerulean bed draperies . Battista grumbled an irritated chuckle . Two more padlocks bound each band , ones equally as intricate and as valued as the first . He knelt before the large chest , knees cracking , leather braces stretching against flexing calf muscles , nettled mumblings unchecked . The duca di Carcaci guarded his treasures well . What a shame I must steal one . The passing thought came and went in Battista 's mind , one tinted with pale regret , brushed away with the impatient hand of his oft-thought though transitory vacillations . He had attempted to acquire the piece through diplomatic and pecuniary methods , had offered the duke a handsome pursemore than generousand with it offered the nobleman a chance to assist Firenze . But both opportunities had been summarily denied , and now Battista must do what he must , whatever it took for his beloved Florence . If such efforts brought him a princely income in the doing , then so be it . He dealt with these locksround , bulbous , and brassas easily as the first , and tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grating creak of the hinges . His glance tripped up and about sheepishly , as if waiting for the door to be thrown open and incarceration to commence . But with no true cause . The stillness continued unabated , as did his thievery . Only his gaze faltered , fixed upon the massive portrait crowning the large bed . Four people gazed back at him , their happiness in the moment and in one another captured and undeniable . The duca , a middle-aged man but with youthful countenance , his wife still pretty , a full figure enhanced by the attentions of a loving husband and the births of their two children . Two girls played at their feet , perhaps two years apart in age , yet identical in their dark-haired beauty and mischievous smiles . Battista recognized his feelings of respect and longing , measured out in equal parts , for he respected a man who loved his family , as his own father had , and desired to see himself the anchor of such a portrait , the patriarch of such a family . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chided himself with a surrendering shrug and a quirk of his lips , and not now . Florence needed him now ; it could not wait while he found love or conceived children . Battista turned his almost-black brown eyes back into the cavernous strongbox , deep-dimpled chin tucked into his chest . His face bloomed at the treasures found within , so many of them made his hand tingle as it passed over them . But he came for only one , and rummaged quietly amidst the costly rubble within until he found it . He stood the small statuette on the palm of his hand and studied every portion of the foot-length carving . There was no mistaking the Gothic style of Nicola Pisano , nor that this piece was a model created more than two hundred years ago as a basis for one portion of the artist 's monumental work on the pulpit of the Siena Cathedral . Few knew this miniature existed , and its anonymity compounded its value tenfold . How Battista 's patron knew of it was not for him to question . Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped the piece , and placed it vertically in the leather satchel resting on his hipworn , smooth , and shiny , curved to his back where it had rested for years , as if it were an organic extremity born with him . Battista closed the strongbox , reattached the locks , andwith a tip of his head in gratitude to the man in the portraitexited the room with the same ease with which he had entered . Quiet hugged the palazzo in its nightly embrace as Battista made his way unremarked and unnoticed to the ground floorwhere Frado waited , impatiently , with their horses , just outside the kitchen door at the rear of the building as agreedand through a statue-guarded foyer and down a west-facing corridor . It had cost Battista little to get the pretty scullery maid to explain the layout of the palazzo : a good dinner , some time in his bedwhich he enjoyed as much as she , bless her feisty heartand she 'd told him of every corridor and door in the palace . Turning left , he did little to muffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile , or contain the strut swinging his hips . Though many locks held the treasure of the house , Battista 's thievery had been far too easily done ; a man with such little a mind for security as this nobleman deserved to be robbed . Battista quickened his step as he neared the end of the corridor and the two doors on either side . A few more steps , into the door on the left , and he 'd be in the kitchen and on his way out . He grinned , lifted the pronged latch , and pulled the door open . All air left his lungs with a wheeze . His eyes protruded almost painfully from his head . The four armed and armor-clad men lounging about the roompolishing swords and playing at dicestared at him with the same bewildered gape ... but only for a fleeting moment . " Arresto ! Stop ! " " Get him ! " The cries erupted as the guards jumped to their feet , overturning chairs , upending tables , in their rush toward the intruder . Battista jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips stretched out at him . " Porca vacca . Damn it ! The right door is the right door ! " Battista cursed himself , slamming the door shut in their faces . Shoulder bolstered against the portal , his whole body trembled as hard warrior bodies crashed against the other side , jarring the door violently in its cradle . With one hand , he set the latch . The other seized the handle of the largest of the three daggers tucked into his belt . He planted one foot back , stretched his arm high and taut above his head , arching his back , stretching like a bow about to launch its arrow . With a propulsive growl , he slammed the dagger into the wood of the door at its edge , penetrating through it and into the jamb surrounding it . Seconds , the thought rushed at him as rushed across the hall . It gives me seconds , no more . Barging through the opposite door , he almost fell into the nearly abandoned kitchen . The house fire embers glowed red in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the blood-colored gloom festering in every corner . Three servants , two boys and a womanthose on night duty should the master return and call for anythingflinched back , already roused by the screaming and banging from across the hall . They stared openmouthed as Battista ran through the room , pulling down copper pots and cauldrons with a deafening clatter as he went , anything to throw between him and the angered guards soon to follow . " Scusi . " He ducked his head sheepishly to the older woman as he rushed by her , seeing his mother 's condemnation in her wrinkled face and narrowed eyes . His steps faltered , his head swung back , and he swiped a biscotto off the counter between them . " Grazie , donna mia . Thank you , my lady . " The woman rolled her eyes , but not without a hint of a grin . With a raucous splintering of wood , the door across the hall ruptured open and the four men burst out , a rushing ocean hurling through a broken dam , tripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sbrigari ! Hurry ! " The old woman flapped her apron at Battista , pointing him to the wide double door in the east corner of the room with one fleshy finger . Battista spared her no more pleasantries , running for escape as the guards jumped and tumbled over the obstacles thrown down in their path . He burst through the doors , gasping at the cool night air as with his last breath . If he did n't move quickly , it would be . In the shadowy courtyard , two horses whinnied in alarm ; a male voice squeaked in almost-feminine surprise . Battista turned to the sound , finding his horse and his accomplice waiting , just as they planned , on the cobbles below the portico , the small , round man no more than a perched ball on the smaller of the two powerful steeds . " We must away ! " Battista shouted , running full tilt now , hurtling himself from the top of the five steps , leaping across the beast 's derriere with a two-handed launch , and landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his groinon his horse 's saddle . " They are on to us , amico mio , " he hissed at the flustered man bouncing on the horse beside him , grabbing the reins and taking control of his mount . " The chase is afoot , my friend . Hiiya ! " The leather straps snapped at his will and his horse leaped forward , Frado 's following , impelled by the panic now thick in the air . The horses ' metal shoes clopped noisily against the stones and into the quiet of the night , thudding onto grass-covered field , an ever-increasing thrumming of urgency . In those seconds Battista had foretold , cries of protest rang out behind them and galloping pursuit exploded , muffling the men 's bellows . " Dio mio .

The sound of pursuit grew ever closer . Battista dared a look and saw their pursuers had taken form , if only as ghostly shadows intent upon malice . Were they close enough for his dagger to find them ? He could n't be sure . No matter , only two blades remained and at least four men came for them , if not more , as the alarm most surely had brought others to the chase . He tugged his horse closer to Frado 's , close enough to see the look of sheer panic upon the man 's round , red-splotched face . " We have no choice . " Battista raised his deep voice over the thunder of the hooves . " We must throw them . " Frado answered with a pitiful look of pleading , but Battista shook his head . " Do it , Frado .

The sounds of pursuit faded behind them , dissipating into the dominion of night 's stillness , returning it to tranquility once more . With more than a modicum of disgust , Frado shook the residual drops of wolf urine off his hand , casting a worried glance toward Battista . " I hope the horses are all right . " Battista 's brows jumped up his forehead as he turned , catching the glint of amusement in his friend 's winking eye .

Inferno " Ack , you son of a dog . You cheated ! " The outrage scaled the stairs , penetrated the door , and trounced upon Battista , waking him from his deep slumber , be it midday or not . Battista pulled a pillow over his head , his arms dropping back to the silk-covered ticking with a plop . His exhaustion permeated every bone and muscle in his laden body . He wanted no more than to sleep a few more hours ; not even the thought of gloating over his prizes could rouse him or his spirit . " I did n't , I swear , Giovanni .

" The next salvo launched , the battle ensued . Men barked at one another ; chairs thrown out scraped across stone floor . Someone threw a punch and it landed with a riotous thwack . " Basta !

Stumbling and tripping to his door , his unsteadiness adding fuel to the flames of his fury , he leaned out the door to scream once again . " Enough ! " Despite himself and his ire , he bit back a smile as silence doused the tomfoolery below , as hissing whispers took the place of childish braying . Battista walked back into his room and stood in the midst of the chaos . He could not remember what time he and Frado had arrived home . They had traveled hard all through the night , not knowing for sure if di Carcaci 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow and find out . They had arrived at Battista 's three-story home on the Street of St. Proculus in the shadow of the Palazzo dei Pazzi as only a smudge of the next day 's light appeared on the horizon ; not a soul had been stirring in the quietest of hours , save for those spirits haunting this ancient city . As he stood with the afternoon sun streaming through his southern windows , he looked down at himself , shiny black hair falling in two large , soft waves to his chin . He still wore his thick hose , though the laces fell loose , the long ties hanging down to his knees . He wore neither boots nor stockings , satchel nor jerkin ; his ecru linen undershirt hung out on one side only , as if he had fallen asleep while trying to dispatch it , and the whole of it was a mass of wrinkles , wounded by the crush of his hard sleep . The night 's antics had exhausted him , not an easy task on a man of his prowess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what a night it was . The sculpture ! The thought of it lurched into his mind . He kicked at the piles of clothing and linens covering the floor , searching for the satchel . With a rejoicing cry , he spied it , rushed to it , and flopped to the floor beside it . Throwing the flap of the bag wide , he took the wrapped bundle in his hands and tenderly unfurled its covers with a cautious grace as if he unclothed a beautiful woman . It had been his night 's conquest and he caressed it with the respect such a distinction deserved .

" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He has to be around here somewhere , " Brooke said , taking one more look outside . She picked her son up and stepped back into the church , letting the door close behind them . " We have to find him fast , Alex . " She walked along the length of the back pew and stopped when they hit the center aisle . Brooke could see the push sweeper lying on the floor up near the pulpit . Charlie had obviously abandoned it when he heard the first hint of thunder . Brooke put Alex back on his feet and tried to listen for Charlie . She looked back at the main entrance . It had clearly gotten darker , and beyond the door 's plated glass , lightning flickered gently , as if God were flashing the porch light for someone who had just missed his driveway . " Charlie ! " Brooke yelled again . " Charlie ! " Alex echoed . They turned and slowly made their way up the main aisle , taking turns calling Charlie 's name and looking for him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it down to the house , " Brooke said , glancing back at the front doors . The sky had gone from green to black . They both flinched at the thick volley of thunder that coincided with a flash of lightning , like an X-ray of the church 's front lawn . " I do n't like this , " Alex said , sounding on the verge of tears . " It 's okay , " she said , still staring at the front doors . She held her hand out behind her for Alex to take . He did n't . " I 'm over here , " Alex whispered . Brooke turned around and could barely see him . He was nothing more than a small shadow kneeling in the pew . " What are you doing ? " " Praying we find Charlie . " Brooke kneeled next to him and struggled to slow her breathing . Please , Lord , keep us safe . She put her arm around Alex and pulled him closer . She could feel his little heart pounding against her palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pulled him closer still . She kissed the top of his head as a violent peal of thunder boomed directly over the church . " No ! " Alex cried . " Let 's go , " Brooke said , taking Alex 's hand . As they rose , she thought she heard something over the rain . It was dark , but she could vaguely make out some of the shadows around them . The pews . The dim outlines of windows . A stack of rarely used folding chairs against the wall . They stepped into the aisle , and Brooke proceeded to look mechanically to her left , then to her right , her head 's slowly shifting movements reminding her of a low-end security camera . She saw little , but she definitely heard something . Charlie . He was crying . But the sound of him was drowned out by thunder so loud it reverberated in her chest , and by the wind that had finally returned with a vengeance . " Make it stop ! " Alex begged , grabbing hold of her leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another finger of lightning darted across the grounds , and Brooke flinched as the entire front lawn disappeared into a brilliant flash of reddish-orange light . It was gone before she could shield her eyes , and the deafening blast that followed shook the building , sending them both instinctively to the floor . She draped her arms around Alex . He was trembling , and she did n't blame him . Whatever had just happened outside was unlike anything she had ever seen or heard . They needed better coverto get out of this big space . " Charlie ! " she yelled , quickly standing and then picking up Alex . " Where are you ? " There was no response . " What if he 's hurt ? " Alex cried . " What in the world ? " she said . " Do you see him , Mom ? " Brooke squinted at the glass of the front doors . Something was burning outside . Flames seemed to float in the dark about ten feet in the air , then rapidly weakened under the assault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex asked . As he spoke , the last of the fire went out . " I think it was the cross , " she answered . " Oh no , " Alex said , like a concerned old man . He leaned his head on her shoulder . " Please , let 's hurry . Let 's find him . " She raised her finger to her lips , gently requesting that he be quiet . As they waited and listened for Charlie , all Brooke could hear was the continuous tapping of the rain on the windows . " A car 's coming , " Alex said . Headlights made their way up into the parking lot of the small church . " It has to be Shirley and Pastor Jim , " she whispered . A peculiar clicking sound came from the other side of the building , restoring the power . Only two of seven lights were on in the sanctuary , offering them no real improvement in their ability to see Charlie , but they both breathed a little easier . " I like that better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " " Can you turn the rest on , Mom ? " " Sure , " she said . They heard a humming sound coming from somewhere in the building and looked at each other . " What 's that noise ? " Alex asked . " I think it 's the vacuum cleaner over in the fellowship hall . I must 've left it on when we lost power . " Alex smiled and she kissed the top of his head again . There was more thunder , but it seemed to be fading . The storm was easing away , and now Brooke was sure she could hear Charlie . " I hope the dumb lights stay on this time , " Alex said . " I wish they " " Shh , " Brooke said , moving slowly toward the front of the church . One dome light cast a peacefully soothing glow over the altar , an old Wurlitzer piano , and a hand-carved pulpit . She tilted her head and lifted her hand . She definitely heard someone sniffle . " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgotten . " We just did , " Brooke said , running her hand through Alex 's bright-red hair . Charlie was up in the nave , lying down between the last two pews , where the choir sat . All she could see of him was the white , size twenty-one tennis shoes on the carpet , sticking out past the end of the bench . Brooke carried Alex up to the choir stalls and stepped into the row in front of Charlie 's hiding spot . She lowered Alex to stand on the seat cushion above Charlie , and they both leaned over and looked down . Charlie Lindy was perfectly still , flat on his back , with his eyes closed and his hands over his ears . " There you are , big guy , " Brooke said . " It 's okay , Charlie . " Alex started giggling . " You big fraidy cat , Charlie ! " " It 's okay , Charlie , " Brooke repeated softly . " The storm is about over . " Charlie opened his eyes and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he immediately shut them again . " It 's all right , " she said assuredly . " It 's going away . " Charlie reluctantly opened his eyes again , and they shifted quickly from side to side . He slowly sat up and lowered his hands from his ears . He smiled at Brooke and pointed at the light switch behind her . " You got it , big guy , " she said . " You 're a big fraidy cat ! " Alex laughed , jumping up and down while holding out his arms for Charlie to take him . " I think we were all afraid , " Brooke said soothingly as she turned to switch on more lights . " No ! " Alex yelled , his voice echoing off the church 's painted white brick walls . Brooke spun around and found herself staring straight into Charlie 's barrel-like chest . His right arm extended firmly out to his side like a thick branch . At the end of that limb , two feet above her head , Alex dangled helplessly facedown as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tiny Levi 's . She smiled and put her hands on her hips . " Okay ! " Alex shouted again , followed by a playful giggle . " Okay , Charlie ! You 're not a fraidy cat ! " Charlie grinned and effortlessly flipped Alex upright to sit on his enormous shoulders . Alex balanced himself by hanging on to one handful of the giant man 's cropped blond hair and another handful of his left ear . Charlie 's oversized fingers wrapped carefully around the boy 's thigh to hold on to him . His other hand slowly lifted , opened , and then revealed a single Tic Tac , which Alex gratefully snatched up . Brooke was giving Charlie a thumbs-up when Shirley Lindy came through the door . Shirley wore a plastic blue poncho and pulled out tissue to wipe away the small beads of water on her wire-rimmed glasses . " Hello there , Alexander , " Shirley said , looking up at him . " Hi , Mrs. Lindy , " he said . " We could n't find Charlie and he scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where is Pastor Jim ? " " I left him out front , " the older woman replied . " What 's he doing out there in the rain ? " Brooke asked . " We have a little problem , " Shirley answered , holding up her hand and reeling in her right index finger , silently inviting them to come and see . Brooke was the first outside as Shirley held the door for a ducking Charlie , who still had Alex saddled comfortably on his shoulders . A gentle fog had rolled onto the property , and the storm had been reduced to a misty drizzle . Brooke 's breath clouded before her mouth and nose . But her eyes were on Pastor Jim . " Oh no , " she sighed . " I saw this happen . " Brooke slid her arms sympathetically around Shirley 's shoulders as Alex lowered his chin to the top of Charlie 's head . Pastor Jim knelt in a shallow puddle with his head down and hands resting on the top half of the large wooden cross that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Chapter Two # Twenty-seven-year-old Carla Miller sat quietly on a corner bar stool at The Pilot Inn . She was halfway into her first Bacardi and Coke and wished she could smoke a cigarette . She took a deep breath and ran her finger slowly down the side of her glass . She had n't had a smoke in over a year and knew the craving would n't last long . It felt kind of good to be in control of something , at least . Despite being one of the area 's most popular watering holes , the storm had made it a slow night at The Pilot . The sticky smells of stale beer that usually haunted the hundred-year-old bar and diner were minimized by both a light crowd and a splintered mop handle that propped the back door partially open , allowing rain-fresh air to waft through . Only one of the televisions was on , making it a little darker than usual , and the Guess Who 's " No Time Left for You " was playing a little too loudly from the corner jukebox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to old songs .

The song ended to the sarcastic applause of an overweight man in his midfifties . A trucker ? A construction worker ? His fat , sausage-like fingers held a bottle of Bud Light as he slammed four quarters down on the edge of the pool table , securing his right to play the current game 's winner . He glanced back at Carla with eyes as gray and worn as his face , giving her the once-over . It did n't bother Carla . Men had always liked her .

@@4161928 Two months earlier Emmett Kyle , a traveling salesman from Fort Worth , had just sold an order of sewing notions to Eb Smalley , owner of Smalley 's Mercantile .

He is one Jim Dandy of a salesman . " Across the street from Smalley 's mercantile , Albert Russell , Harry Toombs , Josh Peters , and Lou Hamilton were in the Long Trail saloon . The four men were sheriff 's deputies , and they had been drinking since early afternoon . The other customers in the saloon tended to stay away from them as much as possible , waiting until one or more of them would pass out drunk .

" And truth to tell , the only thing we 're supposed to do is collect the taxes . " Russell stood up , and when he did , the chair fell over with a loud bang . It got the attention of everyone else in the saloon , and Russell and the other three deputies laughed . " Did n't mean to scare ever'body , " Russell said . He was a little unsteady and he leaned forward , quickly putting his hand down on the table to keep from falling . " You all right there , Al ? " Toombs asked . " Yeah . I just maybe need me a breath of fresh air , is all . " Russell , who was the most inebriated of the four , walked unsteadily over to the batwing doors . He held a whiskey bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drain the rest of its contents , then , when it was empty , tossed it back over his shoulder without bothering to look around . It landed on a table where two other men were sitting . " What the ... ? " one of the men started to say , but the other man reached across the table quickly to stop him from getting up from his chair . " Let it be , " he said quietly . " What do you mean , ' let it be ' ? He could have hit one of us in the head with that . " " You 're just visiting town . Trust me , Deputy Russell is n't someone you want to mess with . " " Who does he think he is ? " " He knows who he is . He is one of Sheriff Poindexter 's men . " " And that means he can do anything he wants ? " " Yes , they pretty much can , and do .

" " It 's what fancy dudes wear in the city . " " Well , what the hell is he wearin ' it here for ? " " More ' n likely he come in on the stage , " Hamilton suggested . " Prob'ly a salesman or something . " " Look there . He 's got ' im a red feather stickin ' up from the hat band , " Russell said . " Ai n't he the dandy , though ?

" " Maybe you ought not to try ... , " Hamilton said , but before he could finish the sentence , the gun roared and smoke streamed from the barrel . " Oh , shit , " Russell said . " I think I hit the little sumbitch . " Smalley was still looking at Kyle when , to his horror , he heard a gunshot and saw a little mist of blood fly out from the side of his head . Kyle went down in a heap . " Emmett ! " Smalley shouted . He ran from his store out into the street and knelt down beside the salesman . His head was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . His eyes were open and unseeing , and he was n't breathing . " It was an accident ! " Russell shouted , coming out into the street then , still holding a smoking pistol . " I did n't mean to shoot him ! " " Where were you ? Over in the saloon ? " Smalley asked . " Yeah , but like I said , it was an accident . " " That 's a good forty yards from here . How do you accidently shoot someone from forty yards away ? " " I do n't know , I ... " " He had his gun out , showin ' it to us , and it went off , " Toombs explained . " Yeah , " Russell said quickly . " Yeah , that 's what happened . I was showin ' ' em my gun , and it just went off . " " What the hell was so interesting about your gun that you had to show it off in a way that wound up killing a man ? " Smalley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you go gettin ' all high falutin ' on me , " Russell said . " I told you I did n't mean to kill the feller .

" " I told you he was showing us his gun and it went off , " Toombs said . " Yeah , that 's what it was , " Russell said . By now a substantial crowd of people had gathered around the salesman 's body , including Sheriff Poindexter . Sheriff Poindexter was square jawed and thick set with black hair and a drooping black mustache . But what set him apart from all other men was his left eye . There was no eyelid for his left eye , and that made it bug out , almost like it was too big for the socket . The blade that had taken off his eyelid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , leaving in its stead a puffy clump of scar tissue . " What happened here ? " Sheriff Poindexter asked . " It was an accident , Sheriff , " Russell said . " I was showin ' these other fellas my gun , and it went off . I did n't mean to kill this little feller . " " Anybody know who he is ? " " His name is Emmett Kyle . He 's a salesman from Fort Worth , " Smalley said . " All right , Russell , since you killed him , you are responsible for him . See to it that Nunnelee gets his body all cleaned up and sent back to Fort Worth . " " All right , " Russell replied . " He got ' ny family there ? " Poindexter asked Smalley . " He 's got a wife and two kids . " " Good , that means we wo n't have to be out any money for his buryin ' . " " Is that all you 're goin ' to do ? " Smalley asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ' ? What do you expect me to do ? " " Investigate it . Good Lord , man , there 's been a killin ' here . " " Nothing to investigate , " Poindexter replied . " It was an accident , pure and simple . " Smalley shook his head in disgust , then walked back into his store . He did n't know Kyle all that well ; he knew him only as a salesman . But Kyle had been working his store for the last three years , and almost always had dinner with him . Smalley had never met Kyle 's family , but he thought of them now , back home in Fort Worth , content and comfortable with the thought that the husband and father would be coming back home to them . " And Sheriff Poindexter is n't going to do a damn thing about it . No investigation , nothing , " Smalley said to Harold Denham . Denham was not only Smalley 's friend ; he was also the owner and publisher of the Sorrento Advocate . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Denham said . " Did you really expect him to do anything ? " " I guess not , " Eb said . " But it does make me angry . I just wish there was something we could do about it . " " Right now the only thing I can do is write about it in the paper and hope I can keep the pot stirred up so that maybe , someday , the people will decide they have had enough of Poindexter . " " And do n't forget Judge Dawes , " Smalley said . " He not only facilitates Sheriff Poindexter , he is in league with him . " " So is Gillespie , the prosecutor . " Death in the Streets of Sorrento Yesterday , Emmett Kyle , a salesman from Fort Worth , was shot down in the street .

This fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullet struck him in the head . The missile was energized by a pistol that was in the hands of Deputy Albert Russell . Russell has made the totally unbelievable claim that his firearm discharged accidentally when he was showing it to Toombs , Hamilton , and Peters , who are also Sheriff 's deputies . It is not surprising that the three deputies verified Russell 's story . However , there were other witnesses in the saloon who tell a completely different tale . The story as told by these witnesses is that Deputy Russell , while in a state of inebriation , attempted to shoot the feather from Mr. Kyle 's hat . This was from a distance of forty yards . It would be a prodigious pistol shot from an expert when he is sober . Deputy Russell missed his mark , his bullet striking Mr. Kyle in the temple . Unfortunately , none of these witnesses will agree to testify against the deputy , and they have given this newspaper their story , only on the promise that they remain anonymous . How long , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain under the despotic control of Judge Dawes , Prosecutor Gillespie , Sheriff Poindexter , and his evil deputies ?

Johnny was a cowboy who rode for the Twin Peaks Ranch . Today was his twenty-first birthday , and he was trying to talk Belle LaForge into giving him a free visit . " Johnny , if I gave you a free visit for your birthday , everyone would be wanting a free visit for their birthday , " Belle replied . " You can see that , ca n't you ?

The albino was n't hard to pick out ; his hair was white , his skin was without color , and his eyes were pink . It was said that he had killed at least ten men , though some insisted that the count was as high as twenty . Drew did n't ride into town like any ordinary visitor . He was wearing a long duster . That in itself was not unusual , because many riders wore dusters on the trail . But Drew wore his duster pulled back and hooked over his pistol , enabling him to get to it quickly , if need be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , he was always aware that someone might try to kill him , either to avenge one of his earlier killings , or to make a name for himself as the one who killed Amos Drew .

He stopped in front of the Bull 's Head , one of the wilder saloons of the town . The Bull 's Head was known for bad women and even worse whiskey . Drew took off his duster and shook the dirt from it before he draped it over his saddle . Then , slapping his hands against his shirt a few times , and raising a cloud of dust by so doing , he stepped up onto the wooden porch and pushed his way in through the batwing doors .

With hands that were shaking so badly that he got as much whiskey out of the glass as in it , he poured Drew a drink . When he picked up the glass it began shaking again , so , quickly , he put the glass down on the bar , then pushed it across . Johnny heard the bartender address Drew , and that got his attention .

Drew made only a casual glance toward the cowboy , then , almost as if he had n't even seen him , he took a drink of his whiskey . " You 're a famous man , Mr. Drew , " the young cowboy said . " I 've heard a lot about you . " Drew took another drink . " Go away . Leave your woman , " he said without looking back toward the young cowboy . Johnny got a confused look on his face . " What ?

@@4161930 It was the stone horse called Apollyon that stomped cruelty into him . The beast stood nineteen hands , and every man was afraid to go near , its hooves and mane wild and black , black and untamed as its eyes . It was not ridden . It did not toil in the field . The unbroken giant was proof that man could not subject every beast to his will . By its size and defiance it became a mythical creature . Apollyon breathed morning 's smoke , exhaled and snorted in such great gusts , it seemed it could breathe fire as well . Gideon Long was never more afraid than when he stood before Apollyon . His father watched from behind the gate , one foot up on the second rail , a gentle smile in place to hide what he was doing . " Go on , " he said . " Go on in there , boy . Brush his hide .

When Gideon was done , he looked to his father , still on the other side of the gate . Harlan Long said to his boy , " Go on . Go on and comb his mane . " Apollyon 's mane was badly tangled . Gideon climbed the stool and stood beside the snorting beast . With tiny hands he lifted the bone teeth of the comb to the hair , and with slow , deliberate , terrified strokes he smoothed the knots from Apollyon 's mane . At last he finished the task , and he looked again to his father , still with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Gideon , though the he knew exactly the sort of devil he was tempting . " Go on , " he said .

With these Apollyon had injured so many unlucky stable boys that none would brave this most perilous task of grooming . The nervous lads who worked the barn climbed up the railings of other stalls and observed the spectacle of Gideon 's torment from the surrounding darkness of the barn . Apollyon 's hooves were grouted with rotten manure and piss . This foul clay required strength and a steady hand with the metal pick to remove . Gideon could feel the power of the beast as he took hold of one of its legs . By pressure he urged the beast to lift that leg , big around as a jug , and he carefully chiseled and levered the stinking muck from the beast 's hoof . The hooves were unshod , overgrown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apollyon stood and snorted and allowed his hooves to be picked clean by the terrified boy . By the time Gideon finished with this task , his arms and legs were shaking . Sweat clung to his body and ran into his eyes . He could bear no further chore , could scarcely stand , and yet when he looked to his father , his father only smiled and said , " Go on . Go on and climb onto his back . Go on and ride him and tame him . Make this beast your horse . " Gideon climbed the stool beside Apollyon . He placed one palm against the gray stone pelt and said , " Please . " Apollyon switched his ears and looked back at Gideon with black eyes that reflected Gideon 's stricken face . The boy took a deep breath and began to climb atop Apollyon 's back . There was a moment , from atop the back of the giant Percheron , that Gideon could see all the stable hands staring in amazement and awe . Awe !

It was not even cruelty itself that caused Apollyon to stomp a great black hoof onto Gideon 's knee so that it broke like dry clay and the child 's blood ran out into his trousers . Not cruelty , and yet this was the affliction Gideon received . Cruelty was the venom injected into his marrow that day . Gideon would forever recall what his father said to him that day . " I knew you could not do it , but I hoped you would prove me wrong . " Gideon imagined he heard his father laughing . He lay there in a state of cold agony , reaching for his father , reaching for nothing until the terrified stable boys dragged him from beneath the hooves of Apollyon. * * * In came Father 's nurse , Adelaide .

Adelaide took an appraising look at Gideon and shook her head . " No , no , he will have a fit . Do you plunder the cemetery for your wardrobe ? " " Good evening , Adelaide . Always a pleasure to see you , as well . " " Do not bear false witness , " she said . Her piggish nose crinkled . " Do you ever bathe ? Or should I ask what you bathe in ?

But you will do it yourself . I 'll not stoop . " Adelaide disappeared down an adjoining hall , and Gideon could hear the receding thump of her shoes on the carpet . A rasping voice called out through the door of the bedchamber . " Adelaide , I need you . " " It is me , Father , " said Gideon . " Junior ? Is that ... my Junior ... who ...

His cane clicked against the floor , and his leg brace squeaked with each turn of the joint . He took a last deep breath before stepping through the threshold into Father 's shrinking domain . The stench of endings filled the room . Father lay withered by time and a procession of disease . He was a fragile thing beneath the overstuff ed down comforter , shrunken in every measurement and capacity . Though waning , he existed still as a fearsome spirit at the outer edges of the world . Gideon wondered if the dead could restlessly seek to pursue their evils . Though he knew the man could no longer strike him with his fists , it was no coincidence that he recalled the horse Apollyon whenever he thought of his father . The bedchamber was crowded . Books and ledgers were piled over what windows might have provided at least a scrap of moonlight . The room was made to seem smaller still by the few oil lamps burning at this late hour . The walls were papered with pictures of pheasants , father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and German landscapes , finished with the garish portraits of ten generations of Longs . The painted eyes of Gideon 's ancestors were uniformly dark , as though something had prevented each painter throughout the many years from finishing their depictions with believably human eyes . Perhaps not so unfinished , Gideon thought as he looked upon the sickly remnants of his father . The old man 's eyes were dark , sunken , glittering coal in the pallid face . Father looked at Gideon with the cold envy of a man unwilling to relinquish history to the next generation . Gideon did not doubt that , were Mephisto to appear to offer his father a bargain , Gideon would find his soul caged in his father 's rotting carcass , while his father lived out a full life in Gideon 's body . Such a trade would suit his father well . " Ah , it 's only you , " said Father . He lifted a palsied hand and motioned Gideon to his bedside . " This long wait for the reaper tests my patience .

Try to calm yourself . Perhaps some sleep . " " Perhaps sleep , " Father said in a voice that mocked Gideon 's tone . " Sage counsel to be sure . History is written by the sleeping .

" I yet have faithful men within your midst , men whose loyalty to my enterprise compels them to report your mismanagement . You can bring in your Dutchman and your fancy machine . Replace white men practiced at the trade with stinking Slavs and all those gutter Chinese . Cheaper , but they will ruin you .

" Your excuses no longer matter to me . I have sent for my attorney . " Gideon felt a fearful lurch and clenching in his gut .

" " Should any of my suspicions prove true , I have already alerted your sister 's husband to be ready to take over the business . " Gideon began to protest , but Father held up a hand to stop him .

The fire started by his lantern was causing a commotion . A shabbily dressed man took off his jacket and used it to beat the spreading flames . Curious inhabitants of nearby shacks were emerging one by one to view the spectacle . The impromptu fireman shouted and pointed to indicate the boy . His only route for escape was in the direction of the river itself . He shoved past a man with the obvious intent of capturing him and leaped onto the wooden decking to the coal wharves of Port Richmond . A half dozen steam colliers crowded the docks . Most were dark and silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead cranes loaded coal into their holds . A cry went up from behind the boy , and he sensed that he was discovered . The boots of several men beat against the dock as they chased him . If they caught him , his life would end , perhaps not by noose , but by some other slow and poisonous method . His fear propelled him , and he ran to the railing . The boy took a last glance back . He bit the blade of the knife and jumped into the Delaware . The cold nearly sent him into shock . He could not swim . Years spent up to his knees in the muck , and he could not swim . He thrashed and kicked and was only just able to keep his head above water . His fingers collided with something , and he grabbed hold . When he bobbed to the surface again , he could see that he was clinging to the rigging of one of the iron-banded steamships .

When he was certain he was not detected , he heaved himself over the railing and onto the deck . It was crowded on the ship . Men with long hair and heavy coats focused on one another or the coal clattering into the hold . Their voices were loud and fearless . He crept across the deck undetected and turned himself sideways to slip into a gap between the ship 's superstructure and its sidewall . Exhaustion and cold took their toll . The boy sagged and lapsed into a restless sleep . His dreams were haunted by bloody visions of his deeds . He awoke for just a moment as the ship departed . Long enough to see the fires of Philadelphia receding into the distance . He next awoke to angry shouting . One of the sailors was leaning half his body into the narrow passage the boy occupied .

Sometimes I improvise around an outline , sometimes I have to learn lines . The only parts of the show that are n't scripted are the fightsand they are only unscripted so far as I know . # None of my special training will be worth a damn when I 'm rolling around in the cottage cheese .

You just have to have that extra handicap in order to bring the humiliation to its peak . Because humiliation is what reality television is all aboutif the audience ca n't watch someone utterly destroyed on camera , rejected by his judges and his peers , face not merely lost but annihilated for all time , it wo n't get its sadistic rocks off . # The witless fucks. # The referee calls Jimmy and me together . As he tells us he wants a clean fight Jimmy looks up at me and snarls . He 's wearing a green mouthpiece impressed with silver letters that read kill you .

If I knew what I was doing , I 'd rip his bowels out . # Master Pak stuffs the mouthpiece in my mouth , leaves the ring , and closes the mesh gate behind him . The audience is baying . It occurs to me that the whole game is set so that Jimmy will win . # " Have Makin train with the TKD guy . " I can hear the producer laughing as he says it . " Then put him in goop so he ca n't kick . " # I wonder if the production staff has money riding on Jimmy . # The referee looks at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouthpiece that I am . Jimmy is also ready . The ref punches the air in front of him . # " Let 's rock the world ! " he says . # Whoooooo . My heart is crashing in my chest . I ca n't see anything outside the ring . Master Pak is shouting at me but I ca n't hear what he 's saying . # The audience noise reaches a crescendo as I slosh forward a couple of steps , then pause to await developments . Jimmy is coming straight on , balled fists on guard , his eyes fixed on my face . I raise my guard . He keeps on . He gets in range and I jab him in the face . # Nothing happens . Jimmy keeps coming . I jab again and he throws a pair of wild punches that miss . I jab and try to maneuver. # The jabs are n't working , even though I can feel them connect and feel the shock all the way to my shoulder . They 're supposed to stop Jimmy or rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punch and keeps coming . So I kick Jimmy somewhere in his midsection. # This works , because Jimmy goes down . Except that I go down , too , because my support leg slips in the cottage cheese . # In wild panic I flounder to my feet , cold cheese chilling my torso . Jimmy 's already up , charging me , swinging wildly again . He 's actually growling . I jab , but there 's cottage cheese on my glove and the punch slips off him . He wraps his arm around me and the crown of his head butts me under my chin . I see stars and the next thing I know I 'm back in the cottage cheese with Jimmy on top of me. # He 's sitting on my chest raining punches down . I cover my face and try some of the techniques that Master Pak taught me to reverse someone on top of me but the cheese is everywhere and we keep slipping . At least he is n't hurting me much . # I wriggle and thrash and manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put my foot against his chest and push and he slides off me. # As I thrash to my feet blackness swims before my eyes . The fight 's just a few seconds long and already I 've run out of steam . # Before I can quite come on guard Jimmy socks me on the side of the head . It feels like a gong going off inside my skull . I back up , trying to put distance between us , and come up against the chain-link wall . Jimmy clamps onto me again and tries to wrestle me into the cheese . It 's like fighting a rabid badger . My chest is heaving with the effort of staying on my feet . # In a rage I pound Jimmy in the body and the back of the head and try to break free , but the punches are too short to be effective , or I 'm too out of breath , or both and then our legs get tangled and I fall into the goop again , twisting away from Jimmy , facedown .

I sprawl face-first into the cottage cheese , and Jimmy begins a flurry of angry punches to the back of my head . None of them is particularly damaging but there are a lot of them . # I ca n't see . I ca n't breathe . Cottage cheese fills my mouth , my nostrils , my ears . Jimmy 's punches rock my world every half- ? second . I try to push myself up from the floor of the ring , but I 'm pushing up Jimmy 's weight as well as my own , and my hands keep slipping out from under me . My lungs are about to explode . # I 'm drowning . The thought sends me into a spasm of activity . I wriggle , I slither , I manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , but he grabs my head and shoves me under again . The bland , salty taste of cottage cheese fills my throat . # Surrender ! I 've got to surrender ! I 'm supposed to tap the mat as a signal that I give up , but the floor is covered by cottage cheese , and no one can see the taps that are growing ever more frantic .

Somewhere I hear the machine-gun sound of a diesel engine-braking . I do n't see a single human being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can that someone 's left at the curb . # If it were n't for the sound of the diesel , you could mistake the scene for one of those movies where everyone dies , and the cities slowly revert to nature . # But no . It 's LA , where everyone I know in the business is far more dangerous than those coyotes ever will be . # In a couple hours I 'll be having my lunch meeting with Dagmar Shaw . I 'll have to tell her that one of her games got me out of bed thinking that someone had been murdered . # Or maybe I wo n't . Maybe , I thought , she hears that all the time . # I realize that I 'm overthinking the meeting . It 's too important . # The lead . In a feature . That possibility has n't existed for me since I was sixteen . Even in Mister Baby Head , I was the title character but not the lead . # I step back into the bedroom and consider the dumbbell that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its place , and I nudge it back under the dresser. # I consider doing my workout before the meeting . I used to belong to a health club before money problems forced me to quit , and since then I 've learned to enjoy pumping iron at home , first thing in the morning , or running on a secondhand treadmill while watching an old movie on my television . Used exercise equipment , it turns out , is a lot cheaper than a membership in a club . # I work out nearly every day . Actors need to stay in good shape , particularly in these days when taut abdomens and tight glutes are more important than ability . # But today I do n't have the time . I shower , dress for the meetblue polo top , cream-colored slacksthen go downstairs to make coffee . While drinking the coffee and eating half a bagel , I go online and check the entertainment news , and there I find out about Dickie Marks 's getting into porn. # Dickie is a few years younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Ladders , in which he played Benjamin Hooks , the troubled son of a firefighter disabled on 9/11 . The series was set in Queens , but of course shot in the parts of Los Angeles deemed by the camera to best resemble New York . For three years in a row he was nominated for an Emmy . I think he won a Golden Globe . # But after Hooks &amp; Ladders , nothing . I ca n't figure out whyDickie had shown he could act , he was good-looking , he was devoted to his craft , and he remained unattached to any scandals involving sex , drugs , or alcohol . But barring a few guest shots and some theater , he 'd stayed unemployed for a decade . # Now he has lent his talent to a porno , using the name Dick Rampant . I ca n't believe it . Did he really think that no one would recognize him ? # What a miserable tool . # I have his private number on speed dial , and in an act of pure sharklike sadism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to voice mail . I 'm not surprised that he 's hiding out . # " This is Sean , " I say . " Dude . What the fuck ? " # If the public remembers Dickie at all , it remembers him as the thirteen-year-old on Hooks &amp; Ladders . Andbarring a few genuinely disturbed fansnobody wants to see that kid having sex ! Not even after he 's grown . # Plus we should consider the puritanical refusal of Middle America , which consumes billions of dollars ' worth of porn every year , to forgive porn actors their sins . # Dickie has managed to get into a dead-end job and alienate what remained of his fan base all at the same time . # " For chrissake , " I say , " you 've got to get ahead of the story somehow . Say you were on drugs or something . " Inspiration strikes . " Or tell them you were looking for love .

SEAN 'S BATHROOMDAY # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself a pep talk . I stare into the mirror , and the Watcher stares back at me. # The Watcher is a character from Marvel Comics , a member of an alien species dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge . He 's lived for millions of years on the Blue Area of the moon , where he observes the Earth , takes lots of notes , practices austerity , and occasionally issues a cryptic warning to the Fantastic Four that a cosmic menace is on the way . # He 's very tall , he 's got a huge bald head , and he 's got weird all-white eyes with no irises . # I look just like the Watcher , except that my eyes are larger and prettier , and he looks better than I do in a toga. # I resemble the Watcher because I have a condition called pedomorphosis . Basically it means that while the rest of my body has aged normally , my head has retained the features of an infant 's . Plus my head is really , really huge . # When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a big head with huge brown eyes , and my extra-babyish features vastly increased my audience appeal . I always looked younger than my actual agewhen I was fifteen I looked twelve or thirteen , all boyish and fuzzy-cheeked , and this hugely increased the number of tween girls who adored me , and massively enhanced my odds of getting sex . # But by sixteen , I was beginning to look a little odd . My dad put it down to an awkward teen growth spurt . By the time I was seventeen , I was two inches over six feet tall and was beginning to look freakish , like a sinister bobblehead doll leering unexpectedly at you from the dashboard of someone 's car . # By the time I was eighteen , it was all over . I looked like something stitched together by Victor Frankenstein , I had no work , my fans had turned away or forgotten me , and my parents had run off with my money . # Even my stalkers deserted me , including the middle-aged grade-school teacher who 'd been sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never get rid of that old perv. # For a few years I tried to turn lemons into lemonade by trying to produce a Watcher movie . Marvel had other projects it was more interested in . I tried to get myself attached to those projects , playing the Watcheror Wolverine , or Kraven the Hunter , or Kitty Pryde , not like I cared . Not like I succeeded , either . # My bathroom is small and smells of mildew . I look at myself in the mirror . " You 're a star , " I tell myself . " You 've got talent . Someday people will notice . " # Affirmations . They 're one of many clich approaches that actors bring to their craft . I took acting classes at one point , and though I 've forgotten everything else , the affirmations are still with me. # Maybe it works because actors ca n't get enough of hearing praise about themselves . # " This is going to be a great interview , " I say , sincerity glowing like soft candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lives staring into mirrors . We try on expressions , we try on attitudes , we recite lines , we study how the dialogue looks on our lips . # I look at myself and repeat the encouraging words . My enormous head gazes back at me. # " You 're a star , " I tell myself . In my dreams . # The bathroom lights gleam off my balding scalp , broad as a piece of armor plate . My eyes are huge and luminous , my nose a stubby afterthought . My ears stand out . The proportions are all wrong for an adult . # At one point I grew a goatee to make myself look more masculine . I shaved it off for Mister Baby Head and never grew it back . Another year I shaved off my hair to disguise the fact that I was balding , but it just made my head look bigger , so I let my fringe grow back . # " You 're going to nail this interview , " I tell myself . " You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , alight with cosmic power . I turn off the light and stalk back into the world . # The Watcher , leaving the Blue Area for Earth . # EXT . RODEO DRIVEDAY # Floyd Steneri , who played my older brother on Family Tree , is a good guy . He did n't seem to mind that I became the big star , leaving him as a supporting character . If the situations had been reversed , I would have hated him like poison . # After Family Tree was canceled , he went to college and got a degree in pharmacy . Because he had his Coogan trust , he was able to actually buy a pharmacy in Wisconsin , after which he got married and had four children . He sends me a photo of the family every Christmassmiling dairy-fed blond Midwestern kids , wholesome as curds and whey . We talk on the phone every so often , and he tells me about taking them to hockey practice . His business is doing well , and he rarely has a bad word to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy ending . He 's out of the business , he 's even out of California . # Is this a win ? It ca n't be . # I think about this as I drive to Beverly Hills , where I 'm meeting Dagmar Shaw . Even though my mom 's pearl-gray Mercedes S-Class is fourteen years old , I 've kept it polished and gleaming , because it 's the sort of car a successful person would drive , and I want people to think I am that person instead of victim of fraud , catastrophic luck , and multiple felonies , which is what I actually am. # I find a parking place a couple blocks from the restaurant and walk . Bright icons and animated figures jump and wave at me from the corners of my vision . Because I could n't find my regular eyewear , I 'm wearing the stupid Aristotle Despopoulos AR shades that I got in the gift bag at the party , and I ca n't turn off the icons . # Without the shades I 'd see Rodeo Drive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasteful , expensive shops , its perfect glossy appearance marred only by a clump of tourists visiting the site of a crucial scene from Pretty Woman . But that 's not what I seeinstead reality is overlaid by dozens of leaping , cavorting images , doormen touting their shops , ads for adult diapers or sex aids , and the inevitable auditions by actors . The Pretty Woman site , for example , is marked by a glowing , rotating Julia Roberts dressed in the spandex shorts and thigh-high streetwalker boots she wore in the filmbut here she 's only one of a couple dozen sex workers competing for my attention , along with an image of the president garbed as the Antichrist , and various political slogans like stop war ! and fight socialism now ! Many of these were placed by people who ca n't exactly spell . # And I see muggers . This is a recent development in AR , created by people who were fed up with the endless proliferation of icons crowding out their cityscape . Muggers are created for the purpose of attacking other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they 're designed cleverly enough , to actually kill them . # I pass one on the way . He looks like Paulie Walnuts from The Sopranos , and he 's using a baseball bat to clout an ad for male enhancement . The other ad looks confused and keeps de-rezzing and appearing somewhere else . It 's a clear violation of Tony Sirico 's physiognomic rights , but it 's hilarious . # " Hey there , Sean , " says a voice . # I turn to see my agent , Cleve Baker , loping toward me. # " Hi , " I say . " You 're not coming to the meeting , are you ? " # Cleve is a tall , well-groomed man of about forty . He came out of the music business and has a law degree . His clothes are casual but up-to-the-second , from the handmade Andean alpaca-wool sandals to the blocky Perry Ellis sweater worn over a white crewneck tee . His wrist plays host to a Blancpain Fifty Fathoms chronograph. # I once asked him why anyone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stared at me. # " No , I wo n't be at the restaurant , " he says . " I 'm going to be in the bar in the next room , and after you dazzle this Dagmar Shaw , I 'm going to sashay in and nail down the contract . " # Agents really should n't be in meetings between the producers and the talentthose kinds of meetings are about finding out whether producers and talent are suited to one another , and agents are about what happens if the answer is yes . Agents step in to negotiate contracts if the talent gets hired . Until then , they should stay out of the process , because their presence just confuses things . # " Cleve , " I say , " I du n no , that does n't sound like a hella great idea " # Then a series of screams sounds from my pocket , and I get out my phone . It 's Dickie Marks . I answer . # " Dude , " I say to the phone . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " Dickie 's voice is subdued , barely audible against the sound of traffic . # " How did you think this was going to end ? " I ask . " Did you think at all ? " # " I did n't think anyone gave a damn about me one way or another , " he says . " My last job was at a burrito stand , for Christ 's sake . I wore a bear costume and a sombrero. " # " Now you can expect jokes about your burrito for the rest of your life , " I say . # I 'm taking a certain pleasure in this . The career of another former child star has augured into the pavement , right in front of the whole world , and he was n't me . Thanks to Dickie Marks , the entertainment news did n't even mention Jimmy Blogjoy 's drowning me in the cottage cheese . # It is n't enough to succeed , as someone said . Others must fail . # On the other hand , I 'm also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gigantic freeway pileup of onetime kid stars , like Darlene Gillespie who went in for securities fraud and perjury , or Gary Coleman who declared bankruptcy and was accused of domestic abuse , Melody Chastain who kicked the dog , or Dana Plato or Michael Jackson or Corey Haim or so many others who found ways of killing themselves . # I have no right to feel superior . I too could leap at a chance to bring my career back , and not realize until it was too late how incredibly stupid and destructive it would be , how utterly desperate and insane I would have to be to even try such a thing # What am I saying ? I 've been that guy . # As witness my attempts to get arrested . As witness Timmi 's getting killed . Now that was crazy . # " Yeah , " Dickie says . There is a moment of silence . " The question is what I do now . " # " I do n't know , man . " # Traffic swishes by as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wizard of Oz march past , singing in silent chorusI thank God that my AR specs do n't have audio . # Dickie 's voice mutters in my ear . # " In your voice mail , you said something about telling people I was just looking for love . " # " Yeah , " I say . # " It makes me sound sort of pathetic . " # I say nothing and wait for the sheer pitiful nature of this statement to sink in . Dickie is far beyond pathetic now , so deep in the cottage cheese that he 's only seconds away from drowning . # For several seconds I watch an icon of Mickey Mouse brandishing a dildo . He 'll be doing that until Disney 's lawyers , which tend to be deadlier than Paulie Walnuts at his best , hammer the host with a writ . # " Yeah , " Dickie says finally . " Okay . I 'm not going to walk away from this without egg on my face . " # " Right , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking for love , I could be in love with with one particular person . " # " Your costar ? " # " God , no ! " For the first time his voice shows animation . " I have some pride left . There 's no way I 'm going to say I 'm in love with Tandee Landes . It was bad enough just having sex with her ! " # " If you say so . " I 've never heard of Tandee Landes , one way or another . # " I mean , she 's the most brainless woman I 've ever met . And those huge boobsthey do n't move . Not even a little bit . They just sit there like flesh-colored concrete and look at you . " He gives a growl of exasperation . " The scene was n't over till four in the morning . It was freezing on the soundstage . It smelled as if someone had died under that couch . And I still had to pretend I wanted to fuck that cow . " # I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about your damn scene , Dickie . " # " How about Samantha Hollock ? " he says . # It 's a name I vaguely remember from about a decade ago . " Is she still in the business ? " I ask . # " She 's retired from acting , but now she 's a producer and director . She produced my movie . I could say I did the movie to get close to her . " # " You fell in love with her , " I say , " when you were just a kid . " # " Yes ! " His voice shows enthusiasm . " I did it for love ! " He sounds as if he believes it . # " You play that scene , Dickie , " I tell him . " You 'll absolutely kill . " # He 'll get nationwide coverage , I think . He 'll get another fifteen minutes of fame , plus become the subject of dozens of jokes by late-night talk show hosts . Then maybe he 'll do a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the butt of yet more fatuous humor . # And then back to the burrito cart . Unless something clicks , and he actually finds work . # But I do n't think so . Try to name actors who came back from porn , and you wo n't find more than a couple . The rest are selling insurance , or working at Burger King . Or dancing in a bear suit in some parking lot . # The traffic light finally changes and I start across the street while putting my phone back in my pocket . Hookers and Mickey and a gaudy ad for Van Cleef and Arpels flash in my AR shades . My phone wo n't go into my pocket the first time and I pause to open the pocket with my free hand . # Horsepower roars somewhere nearby . My pocket wo n't cooperate and I keep trying to jam the phone into it . Then Cleve grabs my arm and yanks me out of the way as a battered black Ford Expedition blasts through the intersection . The slipstream tugs at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodeo in a cloud of blue smoke . My heart hammers in surprise and shock . There 's a sour oily taste on the air . # " Jesus Christ ! " Cleve says . " Get out of the road , Sean , will you ? " # I let him pull me out of the intersection . Impudent Smurfs waggle their blue asses at me . I realize the AR shades are a dangerous distraction and take them off . # I look at the traffic light as I step onto the curb . According to the counter on the display , I have another eight seconds left to cross the street safely . # Maybe in other places , New York or someplace , the driver of the Expedition would n't be so totally unexpected . But in California pedestrians have such absolute right-of-way over vehicles that it 's a little startling that the incident happened at all . # I look at Cleve . " What happened ? " I ask . # " Fucking tourist made an illegal left turn across three lanes of traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ? " # Cleve barks a laugh . " I was too busy keeping the car from getting your number . " # I take a breath and try to calm my thrashing heart . " Well thanks , " I say . # " You 're welcome .

SALO RESTAURANTDAY # Salo is a kind of neo-Mediterranean fine dining establishment , white plaster walls mounted with bright Moroccan carpets that set off dark iron chairs and tables with deliberately crude , blobby welds .

Inside are four dining rooms , each under its own pyramid . # Believers in pyramidology probably think they can eat lunch and get their razor blades sharpened at the same time . # The hostess tells us that our party has already arrived .

Truly I did . # Gripping her leather satchel , Meg headed toward Station Road , glancing at the shop windows with their mounds of fresh oranges and brightly colored paper bells .

Now she had to send for her trunk and hope it could be delivered to the railway station in time for her departure . # She turned the corner and was relieved to see a host of arriving passengers pouring into the street . It seemed the trains were running despite the weather . Easing her pace to manage the downward slope , Meg held out one hand , prepared to grasp a hitching postor a stranger 's elbow , if need be . # Few pedestrians were moving in the direction she was . Instead , they were flowing upward into the town .

Guilt , as sharp as the wintry wind , swept over Meg . Her # parents had looked anything but joyful when she 'd quit Albert Place . Her brother , Alan , was the reason she 'd left , yet Meg had hurt her father and mother all the same . " Forgive me , " she whispered , wishing she 'd said those words earlier . # For two long years she 'd avoided a visit home , praying time might dislodge the bitterness that had taken root in her brother 's heart . But when she 'd arrived in Stirling last evening , she 'd discovered the sad truth . Alan Campbell , four years her junior , was even more churlish and demanding than she 'd remembered and greedy as well , a new and unwelcome affliction . His parting words would follow her back to Edinburghto Thistle Street , to Aunt Jean 's house , to her house . " What a selfish creature you are , Meg .

She could hardly deny Alan 's needs were greater than her own . But when she 'd moved to Edinburgh to care for their late aunt , wrapping her aching limbs with compresses and feeding her bowls of hot soup , Meg had never imagined Aunt Jean would choose to bless her only niece with the gift of her town house . # " Father should have been her heir , " Alan had insisted . Aunt Jean 's will , written in her neat hand , stated otherwise . # Over the midday meal Meg 's conversation with her brother had deteriorated into thinly veiled accusations on his part and tearful denials on hers , until she could bear no more .

And to their love , though Meg wondered if guilt did not play an equal role . # Meg wove through the crowd and kept her head down lest someone recognize her and draw her into a discussion . Much as it grieved her , she had no polite banter to offer , no cheerful holiday sentiments . By tomorrow her mood would surely brighten . Just now she wished to tend her wounds in private . She stepped across the threshold into the railway station and brushed off the snow that clung to her coat , glad to be out of the wind . Inside the nearby booking office a cast-iron stove glowed with heat , steaming up the windows . But in the waiting area and across the broad , open platform , winter prevailed . Holly wreaths , their crimson berries bright against the dark green leaves , decorated the painted iron pillars supporting the roof . Everyone 's arms were filled with packages , as if Saint Nicholas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock mounted below the arched ceiling , then scanned the departure times posted for the Caledonian Railway . The southbound line , which stopped at Larbert , Falkirk , and Linlithgow en route to Edinburgh , departed at three twenty-six .

" Sir , might I engage your services ? " As he swung around with an expectant look on his face , she paused , her resolve flagging . How might her family respond when a porter asked for her belongings ? Her mother would surely burst into tears . And her brother ? He would probably want the contents of her trunk tossed into the street . # Determined not to lose heart , Meg reached for the small coin purse inside her satchel .

She then informed him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # " I know the house , miss . " The coins disappeared into his pocket . " Soon as I deliver this trunk , I 'll see to yours .

Before she could join the handful of outbound travelers waiting to purchase tickets , a small dog appeared and began nipping at the hem of her coat . " Are n't you a fine wee pup ? " she murmured , bending down to stroke the young terrier . Even through her gloves she could feel his wiry coat and the light nip of his teeth as he playfully turned his head this way and that . # Above the din floated a high , reedy voice . " Can it be Miss Campbell come back at last ? " # Edith Darroch . Of all the gossips in Stirling , she took the prize . # Meg slowly rose to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors like a hostess offering scones and jam .

But on this bitterly cold afternoon , she was very much on her own. 
@@4161947 Charlotte # April 14 It was the breeze , a change in the texture of the unseen that made her look up and walk around a stand of shading beech trees . Charlotte paused on the manicured green of the Ludlow Estate for a pure , deep breath , observing the elements of the dayblue sky , spring trees , sunlight bouncing off the parked-car windshields . She 'd woken up this morning with the need to think , to pray , to get closer to heaven . She 'd tugged on her favorite pair of shorts and driven up to the ridge . But instead of solitude , Charlotte found her piece of Red Mountain busy and burdened with shoppers , seekers , and bargain hunters . The annual Ludlow antiques auction to raise money for the poor was in full force on the estate 's luscious grounds . Charlotte raised her sunglasses to the top of her head , resenting the intrusion . This was her personal sanctuary , even if the rest of the world did n't know it . Mama used to bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sneaking Charlotte along the Ludlows ' perimeter , laughing and whispering , " Shh , " as if they were getting away with something fun and juicy . She 'd find a spot on the back side of a knoll , spread a blanket , open a bucket of chicken or a McDonald 's bag , and exhale as she looked out over the valley toward the Magic City . " Is n't it beautiful ? " " Yep , " Charlotte always said , but her eyes were on Mama , not Birmingham 's lights . She was the most beautiful woman Charlotte had ever seen . And almost eighteen years after her death , she still was the most beautiful woman Charlotte had ever seen . Mama had a way of just being , but she died before she imparted that gift to Charlotte . Shouts invaded Charlotte 's memorial moment with Mama . Bidders and buyers moved in and out from under the auction tent spread across the side lawn . Shading her eyes from the angled sunlight , Charlotte stood in the breeze , watching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds ? She did n't need or want anything that might be under that tent . Did n't have the money to buy even if she did . What she needed was to think throughpray abouther recent tensions with Tim 's family . His sister-in-law Katherine specifically . The whole mess challenged her to reconsider the leap she was about to make . As Charlotte turned toward her car , the wind bumped her again and she glanced back . Through the trees and beyond the tent , the second-floor windows of the Ludlow stone-and-glass mansion shone with the golden morning light and appeared to be watching over the proceedings on the ground . Then the wind shifted the light , a shadow passed over the window , and the house seemed to wink at her . Come and see ... " Hey there . " A lofty woman 's voice caused Charlotte to turn around . " You 're not leaving already , are you ? " She lugged up the slope of the lawn with a box in her hands . Charlotte recognized her . Not by name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic Southern women that populated Birmingham . Ones with dewy skin , pressed slacks , cotton tops , and a modest string of pearls . She stopped by Charlotte , breathless . " You 've not even gone up to the auction tent . I saw you pull in , sweetie . Now , come on , we 've beautiful items for auction . Is this your first time here ? " She dipped into the box and pulled out a catalog . " Had to run to my car to get more . We 're busy , busy this year . Well , you can see that by the cars . Remember now , all the proceeds go to the Ludlow Foundation . We give millions in grants and scholarships around the city . " " I 've admired the foundation for quite a while . " Charlotte flipped through the catalog . " I 'm Cleo Favorite , president of the Ludlow Foundation . " She offered Charlotte her hand . " You 're Charlotte Malone . " Charlotte regarded Cleo for a moment , slowly shaking the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or run screaming back to my car ? " Cleo smiled . Her teeth matched her pearls . " My niece was married last year . " " I see . She bought her dress from my shop ? " " She did , and for a while , I believed she was more excited about working with you than marrying her fianc . Quite a business you have there . " " I 've been very fortunate . " More than any poor , orphaned girl dreamed . " Who is your niece ? " " Elizabeth Gunter . She married Dylan Huntington . " Cleo started toward the tent . Charlotte followed so as not to be rude . " Of course , I remember Elizabeth . She was a beautiful bride . " " And she wanted the whole wide world to know it . " Cleo laughed with a pop of her hand against the breeze . " She darn near sent my brother to the poorhouse . But you only get married once , right ? " " I hear that 's the idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement ringthe reason she 'd driven up here today . She paused at the edge of the tent . " So , Charlotte , are you looking for any particular item ? Something for your shop ? " Cleo dropped the box of catalogs on a table and started down the main aisle as if she expected Charlotte would follow . " We have some beautiful wardrobes for sale . The catalog tells you the lot number , when and where to bid . The auctioneer just moves to the piece . We found that to be easier thanwell , what does any of that matter ? It 's a great auction and it runs smoothly . Tell me , what are you looking for ? " Cleo tipped her head to one side and clasped her hands together at her waist . Charlotte stepped under the tent 's shade . " Actually , Cleo , " I came up here to think " my bridal shop is strictly contemporary . " Charlotte rolled the catalog in her hand . " But I guess browsing is always fun . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Why sure it is . You 're bound to find something you like as you ... browse . " Cleo winked . " It works best if you go ahead and give yourself permission to spend some of your hard-earned money . " " I 'll keep that in mind . " Cleo trotted off and Charlotte picked a side aisle to wander , examining the pieces as if the answer she longed for might be lurking among the ancients and the antiques . Maybe she 'd hear , He 's the one , as she passed a twentieth-century breakfront or a nineteenth-century wardrobe . But probably not . Answers did n't often just appear to her out of the ethereal realm . Or drop on her suddenly . She worked for her life answers . Just rolled up her sleeves , evaluated the situation , calculated costs , and decided . She 'd have never opened Malone &amp; Co. otherwise . Charlotte paused in front of a dark wood foyer table and traced her fingers over the surface . Gert had one like this in her foyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the underside had been marked with a red magic marker . It had n't . Charlotte moved on . That table was n't Gert 's . Oh , she 'd been so mad when she discovered her niece had run amuck with that red pen . At the end of the aisle , Charlotte halted with a sigh . She should head back down to the city . Her hair appointment was in a few hours anyway . Instead , she started down the next aisle , let her thoughts wander to Tim and the struggle in her heart . Four months ago she 'd been perfectly ensconced in her steady , predictable , comfortable day-to-day life . Then the contractor who remodeled her shop harangued her into accepting his Christmas dinner invitation . He seated her next to Tim Rose and changed Charlotte 's life . A dull , tired rolltop desk caught her eye . Charlotte stopped in front of it and smoothed her hand along the surface . If the grain could talk , what stories would it tell ? Of a husband figuring the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem ? Of a mama writing a letter to the folks back home ? How many men and women sat at this desk ? One or hundreds ? What were their hopes and dreams ? One piece of furniture surviving time . Was that what she wanted ? To survive , to be a part of something important ? She wanted to feel like she belonged to the Rose family . Katherine certainly did n't make Charlotte feel like a part of the gregarious collection of siblings , aunts , uncles , cousins , and lifelong friends . On their first date when Tim told Charlotte he had four brothers , she could n't even imagine what that felt like . It sounded thrilling . She drilled him with question after question . Charlotte only had Mama . Then old Gert when Mama died . She 'd never lived with a sibling , let alone four of them . Let alone a boy . Was that why she accepted Tim Rose 's proposal after two months ? Fascination ? At the moment , she was n't sure her reason was love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a big family . Charlotte glanced down at the one-carat diamond filigree and platinum engagement ring that had belonged to Tim 's grandmother . But the ring had no answers . She had no answers . " Charlotte Malone ? " A round , pleasant-looking woman approached her from the other side of a dining table . " I read about you in Southern Weddings . You look like your picture . " " I hope that 's a good thing . " Charlotte smiled . " Oh , it is . Your shop sounds magical . Made me wish I was getting married again . " " We hit a lucky break with that piece . " When the editor called last fall , it was the last in a wash of fortunate waves breaking Charlotte 's way . " I 've been married thirty-two years and I read Southern Weddings about as religiously as the Good Book . I just love weddings , do n't you ? " " I certainly love wedding dresses , " Charlotte said . " I suppose you do . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye and moved on , touching Charlotte 's arm gently as she passed . She did love wedding dresses . Since she was a girl , the satin and sheen of white gowns practically made her giddy . She loved the way a bride 's face changed when she slipped on the perfect gown , the way her hopes and dreams swam in her eyes . In fact , she was on the verge of her own transformationslipping on the perfect gown , hopes and dreams swimming in her eyes . So what was the problem ? Why the holdout ? She 'd considered fifteen dresses , tried on none . June 23 would be here before she knew it . A year ago February , she was barely getting by , investing all her capital in inventory while duct-taping her shopa 1920s Mountain Brook cottagetogether . Then an anonymous bank check to the tune of a hundred thousand dollars landed in her account . After weeks of panicked elation trying to find out who would give her so much money , Charlotte redeemed her gift and finally , finally remodeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Alabama , became a client and put her on the map . Southern Weddings called . Then , as if to put a bow on the year , Charlotte attended the Christmas dinner and sat next to a handsome man who charmed everyone in the room . By the time she 'd finished her first course of oyster soup , Tim Rose had captured her heart too . The feathery kiss of destiny sent a shiver over her soul as the breeze rushing over the mountaintop tapped her legs . Did she smell rain ? Dipping her head to see beyond the lip of the tent , Charlotte saw nothing but the glorious sun possessing a crystal blue sky . Not one vanilla cloud in sight . She started down the next aisle and her phone buzzed from her jeans pocket . Dixie . " Hey , Dix , everything okay at the shop ? " " Quiet . But Tawny called . She wants to meet with you tomorrow at three . " Sunday ? " Is everything all right ? Did she sound okay ? Like she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find the perfect gown for Miss Alabama , lying awake at night , whispering to the God of love to help her fulfill Tawny 's dreams . Then she discovered a new , small designer out of Paris and Charlotte knew she 'd found her own brand of white-silk gold . " Call her back and tell her tomorrow is fine . Do we have crackers and cheese in the refreshment bar ? Coffee , tea , water , and soda ? " " We 're all stocked . Tawny seemed enthusiastic , so I do n't think she 's going to tell you she 's going with another shop . " " How long have we been working in the bridal gown business together , Dix ? " " Five years , ever since you opened this place . " Dix , forever pragmatic and calm . " And how many times have we lost a customer at the last minute ? " Even after countless hours of scouring designers to find the perfect gown . " We did n't know what we were doing then . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know very well it has nothing to do with us . Listen , I 'll call Tawny and tell her we 'd be happy to see her tomorrow . " " Already told her . Did n't think you 'd want to turn her down . " Dixie 's voice always carried the weight of confidence . She was a godsend . Support beams for Charlotte 's dream . " So , where are you anyway , Char ? " " Up on Red Mountain . At the Ludlow estate . I came up here to think but ran into the annual auction crowd . I 'm wandering among the antiques as we speak . " " People or things ? " Charlotte grinned , scanning the gray heads among the aisles . " A little of both . " She paused in front of a locked glass of jewels . Unique pieces were the perfect accent for her brides . Charlotte maintained an inventory of one-of-a-kind necklaces , earrings , bracelets , and tiaras . It was the small things that helped seal her success . " Speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were we ? " " Are n't we always ? Your wedding invitations are still on the storeroom desk , Charlotte . Do you want me to bring them home tonight ?

I thought I took them home . " " If you did , they walked back . " " Ha , ha , funny girl you are , Dixie . Yeah , sure , bring them home . I can work on them tomorrow after church . I need to see if Mrs. Rose has a guest list for Tim 's side " " You 're meeting with Tawny at three . " " Right , okay , after I meet with her . Or I can work on them Monday night .

Most psions tried to keep insanity at bay ; Kristen reveled in it . His sixteen-year-old sister destroyed the minds of others in her search for a balance she would never find . Kristen 's dysfunction made her dangerous , yet also powerful . Even at full strength , Lucas was hard-pressed to keep her in check . Kristen was the only person who could have broken Jason 's formidable mental shields and survived . If they were lucky , maybe she had learned how to build sanity out of Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his breath . # Reaching out with a steady hand , Lucas stroked his fingers over Samantha 's tangled blond hair , cradling her head . The eighteen-year-old Class II telepath did n't stir at his touch , her mind a mess that Lucas did n't bother to reach for . He could feel her wounds through his shields , those she sustained at his hands and also at her own . When Samantha severed the bond she once shared with her twin and Lucas 's brother , Gideon , it nearly broke her . Lucas did n't attempt to heal her mind . She knew how to fix herself . # " Why did n't you take your brother ? " Jason asked . " If you 're saving your family from your father , why not save them all ? " # " Aisling has no use for Gideon , " Lucas said as he pulled his hand away from Samantha . He returned to the center row of seats where Jason and Threnody sat . # " What about you ? " # " Family ties mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that hard to believe after you dragged your sisters into this mess . " # Lucas laughed , a dry , hacking sound . " They chose the lesser evil . That 's all . We do n't love each other . We do n't even like each other . They 're going to need to be reminded that this course of action is the right one , or the minute we turn our backs they 'll try to kill us. " # " Your family is really fucked-up. " # " Says the man who was leashed and collared like a dog not even a month ago . " # " I still had people I could rely on , " Jason countered as he lifted his other hand to press it against Threnody 's sternum beneath the blanket . His careful , gentle touch was at odds with the raw anger in his voice . " I still had Kerr . " # The loss was still too recent for the emotion to just be swept aside . Lucas did n't need to be an empath to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , and pain . # " You know , Lucas , I could probably kill you right now , " Jason said , his eyes locked on Threnody 's face . # " I may be suffering from psi shock , but trust me when I say I 'd survive whatever you tried to throw at me . Then I 'd have to mindwipe you , and there goes all my hard work , " Lucas said evenly . " How is Threnody ? " # " I 'm not a psi surgeon . " # " No . You 're something better . " # Jason did n't argue . It was the truth , whether he liked it or not . He sucked in air around his teeth , looking for a balance he was n't sure he would ever get back . It was different , reaching for his telekinesis now that nothing held it back . The depth of his power , the strength , was frightening . He could no longer trust his control or any of his childhood training in the Strykers Syndicate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the power to see the atomic makeup of cells . Channels he never knew existed were now accessible , areas of his mind geared to see the world on a completely different level all synced up now . # Maybe telekinetics who attained Class V strength and could teleport had the potential to become what he was now . Jason did n't know . All he knew was that he did n't want to be the only person who could do this . # Jason tapped into the wealth of power in his mind and let it pour out of him . He slipped through Threnody 's skin down to her bones . An echo of her damage crawled across his own nerves , countless pinpricks of heat and sudden scar tissue that was being absorbed back into her body at an accelerated rate . The new nerve endings created through cellular regeneration were going to take time to rewire , even with Jason able to control the nanites. # " Ow , " Threnody said , grimacing . " That feelsweird. " # " Does it hurt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly . " Threnody frowned , feeling the muscles in her face move stiffly . She peeled skin over the top of her finger and tossed it away . " It feels like my insides are being moved around . " # " I had the nanites target your organs first . I think they 're still working on them . " Jason adjusted the placement of his hands . " The reason you lived long enough for me to help you was due to your electrokinesis . You 'd be dead if you were any other kind of psion . " # " That makes me feel so much better . Really . " She flexed her fingers carefully . " How did you fix me without a biotank ? " # " Take a wild guess . " # The lightning strike that seared through Threnody 's body and jump-started the power plant back in the sprawl of Buffalo had fried her entire body . When Quinton finally found her , he had n't been sure she was even alive , but her electrokinesis had preserved her brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body , then shocked it back to life over and over again , a dangerous cycle that her system had struggled to overcome . Only when Lucas arrived to keep her heart beating to a steady rhythm with his telekinesis did Threnody start to stabilize. # Jason did the rest . He was still doing the rest . # The amount of power Jason carried now left him seeing the worldliterallythrough new eyes . His optic nerves shifted through spectrums of vision that should have been impossible for any human or psion to process without biomodifications . It made him nauseous , especially when magnification was thrown into the mix , allowing him to see the microscopic with the naked eye . # The nanites were doing their job . Threnody was alive and healing . For now , that was enough . # Jason carefully pulled his power out of her body , letting every last cell and nanite go , until he could no longer even visualize the layers of skin cells and capillaries that made up his eyelids . His head felt heavy . He watched as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constant beeping of her cardiac rhythm was almost lulling. # Jason shifted his focus to Lucas , sinking his power into the younger man 's body . It showed Jason the dark spots in Lucas where trauma had left ugly pools of damage beneath his skin . # " I can feel you , " Lucas said as he finished securing the IV bag . " Get your power off me . Now . " # " You 've got bleeding in your brain . " # " I 'm handling it . " # " Not well enough . That subdural hematoma is n't going to fix itself . Let me do something about it . " # " You finally get full access to your power and suddenly you think you can do the impossible . " # Jason arched an eyebrow as he pushed himself to his feet . " That is why you were after me , right ? " # " I 'm not the only one , " Lucas said as he went to toss the used bag in the head 's disposal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nathan . " # Nathan Serca , the oldest psion alive at the age of fifty-one , was a Class I triad psion that Lucas rivaled in power , if not cruelty . Lucas 's father had no equal when it came to cruelty . # Lucas came back out , nodding at Jason 's answer . " And every last Warhound at his disposal , so remember to read as human on the mental grid , at least until the launch , or you 'll get us all killed . " # Unlike Warhounds , Strykers were never taught how to match their psi signature to a human 's , reading as human on the mental grid , that vast psychic plane of the world 's thoughts . But Jason was n't a Stryker anymore , and Lucas had taught him how to shield on the flight over , literally dumping the information straight into Jason 's mind and letting the microtelekinetic sort through the overload on his own . There had n't been time for subtlety , but Jason still got his shielding right . # Jason looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan 's children were turning their backs on their heritage , but Jason still did n't trust them . One of the founding families of the society that survived the Border Wars , the Serca Syndicate they owned was well-known for its forays into politics and government-restricted sciences . Genetic manipulation and segregation were just the beginning . The Sercas were the ones to force the Fifth Generation Act on the world , beginning the long cleanup of tainted and mutated human genetics . The Act went hand in hand with another Serca creation , the Registry , a list of people whose genetic makeup was clean and utterly human . The Sercas had placed themselves on top of the list , though they were far from human . # The Sercas had freedom and they wanted to remake humanity on Mars Colony , with themselves ruling atop society . The World Court and their chosen elite contemporaries were planning to inherit what the world 's ancestors had left themMars Colony . They dreamed of a utopia and a chance to start over . Caught in between were the Strykers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to save what was left of the world and their own skins . The whole mess of false fronts and alliances was the reason why they were here , on Spitsbergen , following Lucas . Jason owed him for more than just removing the neurotracker that was once grafted to his brain , but that knowledge was a bitter pill to swallow . # " Sit down , " Jason said flatly . " Let me fix you . " # Lucas seemed amused by Jason 's temerity . " Do you honestly think Nathan has n't inflicted worse on me before ? I 'll be fine . " # " Do n't compare me to Nathan . " Jason scowled , but his gaze held steady . " I 'm not going to kill you . Now sit the fuck down and let me take a look at your brain . We still need you , Lucas . Even I know that . " # " How altruistic of you . " # " Just take a damn seat . " # " You should listen to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being such an obnoxious pain in the ass . " # " I 'll take that as a compliment because I 'm not arguing with someone in your current state . " Jason eyed her . " You should lie down , Threnody. " # With Jason 's help , Threnody once again stretched out on the row of seats that was her berth , wrapped securely in thermal blankets and modified harness straps to keep her stable . Once Jason saw to Threnody , he headed over to Lucas , picking up a hypospray half-full of nanites from a case as he moved through the cargo bay . They could n't afford weakness , and all of them were damaged in some way . Recovery was going to be slow for some , quicker for others , but even Jason knew that if they wanted to survive what was coming , they would need Lucas at full strength . # " Get the bleeding stopped , " Lucas said as he sat down beside Samantha and let Jason inject him in the throat with a dosage of nanites . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Lucas with one hand , his other curving carefully over the left side of Lucas 's skull , pale blond hair beneath his fingers a dirty mess . Jason closed his eyes , bent his head , and let his power seep into Lucas 's skull . Down through the blood-brain barrier , down to the dura mater , into the brain itself with its swollen tear , just a few centimeters long . Jason could feel where Lucas had picked at it telekinetically , struggling to ease the pressure there with a power that could n't compete with the one Jason now wielded. # " Messy , " Jason muttered . # " I do n't need your opinion on how I keep myself alive . " # Jason dug his fingernails into Lucas 's scalp . " Be still . " # Jason saw capillaries and cell structure , flash images of hemoglobin and plasma , as he worked through nanites to carefully reattach torn capillaries . Blood flow returned and the swollen tension in the cells around the area began to fade . Jason spread his microtelekinesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray blood cells that were shifting into clots and teleporting them out of Lucas 's body . Tiny drops of red splattered intermittently to the shuttle 's deck until Jason was certain he 'd done enough to ensure that Lucas would n't keel over and die from an aneurysm right when they needed him most . # Jason retracted his power , opening his eyes . The layers in the world wavered and it took effort to fix his vision . He wondered if he would ever get used to this , to the way he could see things , feel things , through his power . # " I never wanted to be this . " # " This is what you were born to be , " Lucas said , satisfaction curling through his voice . " I 'm not the only one the world needs . " # Jason 's answer to that was a twisted smile that reminded Lucas of Kristen . Lucas found little comfort in the expression . They stared at each other for a moment , the only sounds in the cargo bay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . # " You 're awake " came Matron 's rough voice a few seconds later . She stood in the open hatch with her arms crossed over her chest , tapping her foot . " Get your ass up here , Jason . Novak needs some help with the hack. " # Jason straightened up , but did n't move . Lucas smiled tightly at him . " Go . " # " All right . " Jason left the cargo bay for the flight deck . # " How come you 're the only one not bleeding out their eyes ? " Matron asked as he took over the navigator 's seat . # Jason reached for a wire embedded in the controls . " I do n't know . " # His fingers brushed over faint flecks of blood on the console , his power momentarily slipping free of his control . It seeped into the blood , and the only DNA he could identify in the fluid was Lucas 's . He grimaced , clenching down hard on his control . # The world looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # 
@@4162070 FOUL TERRITORY # Fifty thousand fans filled the seats just outside the clubhouse , yet Cory Brand felt alone . Alone with an aching knee despite the handful of Vicodin he 'd already downed. # There was no way he was going to let them start digging around his knee . The next thing they 'd be doing would be telling him he 'd have to get season-ending surgery . He was n't going on DL , not this early in the season , not when he was in the middle of a slump in the final year of his contract with the Grizzlies. # I 've been dealing with pain all my life . I can deal with this . # It was the middle of June , and he was moving slow . His knee was n't getting any better , even though a week ago he 'd told the trainers it was fine . If you hit the ball hard enough , he rationalized , you did n't have to kill yourself racing around the bases . All it took was one right smack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . # The mood before the game was about as exciting as the last five games the Denver Grizzlies had played . Cory took a sip from his thermal travel mug with the team logo on it as he sat in the chair in front of his lockers and glanced at the nearby television screen . His two lockers stood between those of the two other all-stars on the team . Once the idea of having a locker in a major-league clubhouse would have been unthinkable . Now it was just another one of those things he took for granted . # Sometimes you dream about something your whole life only to forget about it once the dream has arrived . # Because even dreams can be a lot of work . A whole lot of work . # " It 's a blessed day here at the ballpark ! " # The chirpy announcer on the screen sounded extra happy as he waxed poetic . Cory took another sip and rolled his eyes . # Yeah , another blessed day to take people 's money . # " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nostalgic , all-American pie . " # On the screen a banner read Young Life Welcomes You ! Happy Father 's Day ! # So that was the big deal . Explained why the announcer was giving it his A-game . Fog still filled Cory 's head from last nightat least what he could remember about last night . Now he had to go out and smile and celebrate all the love and joy of fatherhood. # Fabulous . # That 's why it looked like a circus out there . The monitor showed the field littered with lots of fathers playing catch with their sons and daughters . The excitement was almost enough to make everybody out there forget about yesterday 's loss . Or the losing streak the team was on . But not the subdued guys in the clubhouse. # " What 's up , Brand ? " # Rogers did n't seem to care much for Cory and his habits , but he kept his mouth shut and kept his faith to himself . Rogers had his cross and Cory had his coffee mug , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motivation to make it through another game in a very long season . They were men with jobs to do . Rogers had two lockers just like Cory did . Along with Mayhee , they made up the all-star row of the Grizzlies clubhouse , the guys closest to the exit in case the media got a little too overbearing . Cory had heard that Willie Mays had had only one locker , but times were different now , and stars got two and sometimes even more . # His mouth felt dry , and his eyelids did n't want to rise . Cory took another sip and thought of the kids out there playing . Personally , he 'd rather be smiling at them than at those overbearing , overweight fans who only lived to ridicule you once your season was taking a nosedive into the dirt . Kids had n't mastered the art of booing yet . Even though it just came with the territory , the criticism annoyed Cory , especially on days like today . # Cory 's usual game-day routine involved cranking his iPod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt too much to do that today . He looked around and saw that Benny was rocking out with a pair of yellow headphones on that made him look like one of those guys on the airport tarmac who steered planes to their gates . Nearby , Gonzalez stood shirtless , showing off his carefully chiseled physique . You 'd think a guy so disciplined and ripped could hit a ball a little better , but everybody knew it was n't just about strength . # Cory once heard a guy sum up the science behind hitting a home-run ball . It had been interesting for the first thirty seconds , then began to bore him . He 'd always been that way with baseball . The whole numbers game , for instance . Bored the life out of him . The history of the game . The incredible " aura " and all that nonsense . None of that did anything for him except make him thirsty . # He 'd let others be enamored with this little round thing that you struck with a wedge of wood . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called batting slump and his so-declared career-worst .256 batting average this year . # Those things did n't bother him . What bothered him was the buzzing of flies in his head and the throbbing pain in his knee . He was already doing something for the former and decided to grab an ice pack for his knee . # Their relatively new clubhouse was eighty-five thousand square feet of space , with televisions all around and leather couches and love seats in the middle . On some days it still did n't feel big or luxurious enough . On days when the night games and flights back home seemed endless and it took a lot more to get the body and mind up for the game , Cory felt like he was in an expensive commercial made for someone else . # " Hey , Brand , how 'd you make out with that chick last night ? " It was Bruce , their tank of a catcher , asking . # " Same as always , " Cory said , clicking on the flash of his grin . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , right . # Cory could n't even remember her name , if he had to be honest . It was something ending with ee , like Stephanie or Emily . She 'd wanted to come over to his condo , but he had n't been that drunk . The last thing he needed during a season like this one was to come home and find some woman boiling a rabbit in his kitchen . # By the time Helene rushed into the clubhouse in her typical high-caffeinated manner , most of the players had already gone out to the field . The start time for the game was five . Cory was taking his sweet time . Because of the knee . And maybe because he knew what awaited him outside . # " What 's this I hear about you chatting with Capano last night at the fund-raiser ? " # " Relax , Helene . You 're the only girl for me . " He admired her legs as always and grinned . " Though he did offer me his firstborn . " # His fashionista agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a Denver Grizzlies home game . Cory laughed at her high heels that seemed to sparkle . Her chocolate skin looked smooth and soft , but Cory knew the rough and tough fighter beneath the sexy exterior . # Helene barely paid his joke any attention as her thumb worked her iPhone. # " You 'd have to be really drunk to think that was a good deal , " Cory added . # Which , in fact , I really was . # " That animal would eat his firstborn if it meant signing a new player . " # Cory tossed the ice bag on the floor and then rubbed his temple . " Last night was all pretty much a blur . I do n't think I signed anything . " # Helene ignored his comment . She was like a parent who was physically in the room but had n't left her work and office behind . Not that Cory really knew anything about that . # " How 's the knee ? " she asked as her eyes moved from her phone to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't standing . Not yet . # " It 's never felt better , " he said . " Give me a minute . " # There were lots of things he spoke about with Helene , but his knee was n't one of them . If pressed , he 'd tell her the same thing he told everybody else . It was fine . Wonderful . # A knee does n't hit baseballs . A knee does n't spend the game in left field waiting for pop-ups . A knee does n't really matter unless it 's completely gone . # Cory knew that Helene had other players on her roster . None as big as Cory Brand , of course . But that did n't mean she could n't find the next young stallion ready to play ball and make everybody millions . She 'd gladly hop off the saddle and jump on another if she knew that fame and fortune would follow . # His eyes followed her shapely figure out the door .

He found the vodka and emptied the rest into the Grizzlies cup . # It took him a quick swallow to drain it . # He did n't rush to hide the empty bottle , nor did he look around to wonder if anybody was watching . Nobody paid any attention to him in this room . It was out there , in the open air and bright lights under the heavens ... that 's when the world paid attention to his every move . # One hundred and sixty-two games .

They were just above the dugout , overseeing a team of ten- and eleven-year-olds , and so far everything had been perfect . The weather and the chance to get on the field and throw balls around and even the invitation for Carlos to be the batboy . It was a dream come true for Carlos . # Of course , Carlos was their dream come true . # For a moment Clay replayed the game of catch they had just enjoyed . For the ten-year-old kid born and raised in Guatemala , it had probably been just that . A game of catch while standing on the grass of Samson Field . But for Clay and his wife , Karen , who stood nearby taking pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos was an answer to prayer , a prayer they had uttered hundreds if not thousands of times . A prayer that had gone unanswered for a very long time . # " What should I ask him first ? " Carlos had said . " I got a lot of questions . " The joyous smile and the bright eyes were lit up as big as stadium lights after sunset . # Clay had simply smiled , the proud father of a boy who was excited to meet his famous uncle for the first time . " Whatever you want , slugger . It 's your big day . " # Karen had shared her doubts , but every time , Clay had told her everything would be okay . In his mind he saw the picture of their familynot just the two of them with Carlos in the middle , but Cory standing next to them as well . Cory was always a part of this family , no matter what Karen might think or how little they saw him . # " I want to know his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a curveball . And what he likes to do on the weekends . You knowwhen he 's not playing baseball . " # Clay could probably have answered that question himself , but the answer would have been R-rated . For now , it was simply important that Cory meet his nephew for the first time . And what better day for it than Father 's Day ? # " So Carlos . Ya think you 're ready ? " # " Only for like four hundred hours now , " Carlos gushed . " I ca n't believe Cory Brand is my new uncle . " # Clay had thrown his son the ball and then walked over to him . It was a good thing he was wearing sunglasses , because his eyes had teared up , and Carlos would have asked what was wrong . # The lovelove he had questioned would ever comeburst out of Clay 's heart and rushed into every inch of his body . He still could n't believe God had granted it . Adopting a child was n't a simple and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avail . But God had opened the doors , and through it had walked this ten-year-old bolt of energy . # Nothing is wrong , Carlos . I just still ca n't believe you 're my son . # Clay had taken the ball back and joked , " Yep . Cory 's a pretty big deal . " # But inside all he could think was that Carlos was the big deal . And he hopedhe hoped and prayedthat Cory would get over himself for just a short while and realize the same thing . # Now , as most of the players were already out on the field but Cory was nowhere to be seen , Clay began to worry . The commotion of getting all the Bulldogs and their fathers off the field and into their seats was an accomplishment in itself . Clay had kept stalling , hoping his brother would come out and say hello to everybody . He understood that Cory was about to play a really big home game , but he still had hoped ... # No , I do n't get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were all down there . # The look on Karen 's face had said it all . It was the same look she gave him every time he mentioned his brother . # Now the typical look of cynicism was accompanied by concern . # " Do you think Cory will remember that 's Carlos down there ? " Karen asked . # Clay glanced out to the field , where Carlos was talking Jesse Rogers 's ears off . The all-star pitcher did n't seem to mind . # " I have no idea . " # " Or who Carlos is ? " # Clay only shrugged . # I should 've made 100 percent sure that Cory got my messages . # But who did n't get three voice mails and four emails ?

" Karen asked . # " It does n't matter , " Clay said , no longer thinking about his brother . " We still get to take Carlos home . " # If Cory does n't know , then he 's going to miss out on the best thing that 's ever happened to me. # " You know , " Karen said in a voice that always reassured him , " he looks pretty good on that field .

The poor guy just wants to go home . He probably thought he was pretty hot stuff , whipping the ball like that and striking out all the other kids . But Cory knows now he 's not like the other kids . # This is his fourth time at bat . The last three times resulted in three home runs .
