 Kittridge had gotten Warren 's address off his invoice . By the time he moved inWarren presumably snug and safe in Alaskait was simply a matter of finding the right key in the manager 's office , putting it into the slot in the elevator panel , and riding eighteen floors to the penthouse . He unloaded his gear . A rolling suitcase of clothes , three lockers of weaponry , a hand-crank radio , night-vision binoculars , flares , a first-aid kit , bottles of bleach , an arc welder to seal the doors of the elevator , his trusty laptop with its portable satellite dish , a box of books , and enough food and water to last a month . The view from the balcony , which ran the length of the west side of the building , was a sweeping 180 degrees , looking toward Interstate 25 and Mile High field . He 'd positioned cameras equipped with motion detectors at each end of the balcony , one to cover the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the avenue . He figured he 'd get a lot of good footage this way , but the money shots would be actual kills . The weapon he 'd selected was a Remington bolt-action 700P , .338 caliber a nice balance of accuracy and stopping power , zeroing out at three hundred yards . To this he 'd affixed a digital video scope with infrared . Using the binoculars , he would isolate his target ; the rifle , mounted on a bipod at the edge of the balcony , would do the rest .  On the first night , windless and lit by a waning quarter moon , Kittridge had shot seven : five on the avenue , one on the opposite roof , and one more through the window of a bank at street level . It was the last one that made him famous . The creature , or vampire , or whatever it wasthe official term was " Infected Person " had looked straight into the lens just before Kittridge put one through the sweet spot . Uploaded to YouTube , the image had traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major networks had picked it up . Who is this man ? everyone wanted to know . Who is this fearless-crazy-suicidal man , barricaded in a Denver high-rise , making his last stand ? 

 A small silence descended over them . Outside the Oval Office , the sound of a leaf blower was briefly heard , just inside the wall of reinforced concrete barriers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendricks could see no leaves . But then , all work in and around the White House was inherently secretive .  Hendricks cleared his throat . " Nevertheless , sir , it 's my unwavering belief that he is a significant threat to this country . " 

 When she first fell in love with Jack , she had dreamed she could fly , that on a warm , inky black night she had pushed off the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stars in her nightgown . The sensation had returned .  Through the window , the night air appeared dense , each snowflake slowed in its long , tumbling fall through the black . It was the kind of snow that brought children running out their doors , made them turn their faces skyward , and spin in circles with their arms outstretched . 

 Through the window , the night air appeared dense , each snowflake slowed in its long , tumbling fall through the black . It was the kind of snow that brought children running out their doors , made them turn their faces skyward , and spin in circles with their arms outstretched .  She stood spellbound in her apron , a washrag in her hand . Perhaps it was the recollection of that dream , or the hypnotic nature of the spinning snow . Maybe it was Esther in her overalls and flowered blouse , shooting bears and laughing out loud . 

 The life sentence he had once feared , he was now serving : the family business , his wife , his child , his house in the Lawrence Estates , inherited from his mother after she died . Every day except Sunday he drove to the store at eight , parked behind it , facing the Mystic River , checked the inventory and deliveries with Les Armstrong and Mike Corbett , and opened at nine . At noon , a sandwich at Savage 's , the deli across Riverside Avenue ; after lunch , the store . Sometimes Les or Mike reminisced about their years in the army , in dreamy voices , but they were always talking about war . Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to his friend Roy , who sometimes dropped in . At five-thirty , when Les and the others left , he locked the front door and went home to dinner .  It was the life that many people led , and luckier than most . Having a men 's store in Medford Square made his work also social , and selling expensive clothes meant he dressed well . 

 I am better . Far better .  Yet he still had to unzip his fly to do his personal business , just like every other man , rich or poor . He studied the wall in front of him , the graffiti and filthy language written there . He finally looked away in disgust . It was the Western influence that had brought such things , of that he was convinced . In that world , women could drive cars , vote , work outside the house , and dress like whores . It was ruining the world . Even his country now said that women could vote and do other things that only men should be able to do . The king was insane and , worse , a puppet of the West . 

 " Says Protect and Serve ' on the side a the car , " Edgar added . " We did n't do much of either . "  Bosch remained silent . Not that he disagreed with his partner . The department had embarrassed itself with its feeble response to the initial breakout of violence . But Harry was n't thinking about that . He had been struck by what the sergeant had said about the victim being a she . It was the first mention of that , and as far as Bosch knew , there had n't been any female murder victims so far . This was n't to say that women were n't involved in the violence that had raked the city . Looting and burning were equal-opportunity endeavors . Bosch had seen women engaged in both . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood Boulevard and had witnessed the looting of Frederick 's , the famous lingerie store . Half the looters had been women . 

 His airplane was parked on the tarmac , which formed a concrete apron in front of the corrugated metal hangar . It had seen better days . It had seen better days twenty or so years ago , when Dent had first started hanging around .  Johnsongrass grew like fringe around the base of the rusted exterior walls of the hangar . The faded orange wind sock was the only one Dent had ever seen there , and he figured it was the original that had been attached to the pole shortly after World War II . 

 Being more familiar with the deceased than I might wish to be , I can tell you from considerable personal experience that the spirits of the lingering dead do n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been brutally murdered and are desperate to see their assailants brought to justice , they are unable to convey essential information to me either by phone or face-to-face . Neither do they send text messages . Maybe that 's because , given the opportunity , they would reveal something about death and the world beyond that we the living are not meant to know .  Anyway , the dead can be even more frustrating to deal with than are many of the living , which is astonishing when you consider that it 's the living who run the Department of Motor Vehicles . 

 Day Three  By the third day , some of the shock had worn off . The pupils of Maria 's eyes shrank back to normal size , and once she made a clown face at little Charles when he poked his head out from beneath his mother 's skirt . We had traveled far enough that we no longer encountered pieces of the wreckage , or perhaps we had kept our place and it was the debris that had moved . In any case , there was nothing left of the Empress Alexandra . She might never have been , but how then to account for our plight ? I thought of her as I have often thought of Godresponsible for everything , but out of sight and maybe annihilated , splintered on the rocks of his own creation . 

 She jabs a finger in the direction of the other girl and her lips peel back . " I was out here hangin ' and that fuckin ' ho jumped me. "  The words dishearten me , but it 's the hatred behind them that chafes my sensibilities . I do n't know when kids started talking this way , but I detest it . Do n't get me wrong ; I 'm not nave . I 've heard worse words in the course of my law-enforcement career , many of which I 've been the target of . But hearing that kind of rhetoric from such a pretty young woman somehow shocks me. 

 Tessio stubbed out his cigarette in a black ashtray beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who 's ' jackin ' his shipments . He 's shakin ' his fist at us , and then he 's gon na wait and see what happens . "  Genco , on the edge of shouting , said , " Vito . He 's sending us a message : If we 're stealing from him , we 'd better stop . If we 're not , we 'd better find out who is and put an end to itfor the sake of our own health . His capos know we 're not stupid enough to steal a few dollars , but they figure they concentrate on the business with LaConti and they get us to do this little bit of dirty work for them and take care of this problem . That way they do n't have to be botheredand you can bet it 's the Barzinis who figured out to play it this way . " He found a cigar in his coat pocket and tore the wrapping off it . " Vito , " he said . " Listen to your consigliere . " 

 By then , Professor Tendler had had enough . He proceeded to beat Shimmy Gezer . He did n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flipped Shimmy over , straddled his body , and pounded it down until it was level with the sand . He beat his friend until his friend could n't take any more beating , and then he beat him some more . Finally , he climbed off Shimmy , looked up into the hot sun , and pushed through the crowd of soldiers who had assembled in the minutes since the Egyptians sat down to their fate . Tendler went off to have a smoke .  For those who had come running at the sound of gunfire and found five bodies in the sand , it was the consensus that a pummeled Shimmy Gezer looked to be in the worst condition of the bunch . 

 " You want me to leave then ? " he asked in that wonderful baritone that had a way of sending chills over her . Gods , how she lived for the sound of his true voice  Most of all , she loved to hear him laugh . It was the most infectious sound that seemed to come from some place deep within him . 

 That part was easy to understand . When you had a boat full of liquor coming across the lake , you took your chances that hijackers might be waiting for you . Now it was indoor-grown hydroponic marijuana , at which apparently the Canadians are just as handy as they were for producing those bottles of Old Cabin Whiskey back in the day . Now it was an airplane instead of a wooden motorboat . But the basic idea was the same .  It was the kind of story that made me think back to my own days as a police officer , how it sometimes felt like I was the little Dutch boy trying to plug the hole in the dike . That 's really as much as I thought about it . It was an interesting story , but I forgot about it five minutes after I folded up the paper and had my second cold Molson . How it could have any effect on me or on anybody I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine , even if I had known enough to try . 

 " Jitty ! "  Perhaps it was the fact that I was about to weep , or maybe it was Sweetie Pie 's soft slumbering howls , a sound as desolate as a train whistle at a Delta crossroads on a winter 's night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd responded to my call . She came around the corner of the house , arms akimbo , and I was stunned at her A-line skirt , twin sweater set , pearls , and Toni-permed hair . She appeared to be in her late teens or early twenties , though she was dressed like a spinster . 

@@4161704 Chapter 1  The admissions process to get into the Atwood School had eaten up six months of the previous winter , and driven each of the families nearly to distraction with open houses , meet and greets , intense interviews with the parents , sometimes two of them , and screenings of each child . Siblings had some preferential advantage , but each child was evaluated on their own merits , whether he or she had a sibling in the school or not . Atwood was one of the few coed private schools in San Franciscomost of the old established schools were single sexand it was the only one that went from kindergarten through twelfth grade , making it highly desirable for families who did n't want to go through the whole process again for either middle school or high school . 

 " Up there on the second floor . " Sandra pointed . " The first window on this end . He might still be there . " Sandra shivered . " I 'm afraid he killed her , Danny . "  Rhodes stared up at the window she 'd indicated . It was the only window along that side with all the glass panes intact . Rhodes thought he 'd better take a look up there before whoever Sandra had seen took a notion to leave , never to be seen again . If he had n't left already . 

 " Where 's my wife ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's here . I can smell herher cooking , that is . She 's creating a magnificent cookbook for the Lady Lemmings. "  " I beg your pardon , " Hugh said icily . " But it 's my wife who is creating that cookbook and Oooof ! " There was the sound of a scuffle . " Come back here ! " 

 She was handling the bones as if they were made of Venetian glass , taking up the skull , shoulders , arms , and spine and laying them carefully into a perfectly molded satin receptacle in a long leather case .  She looked up once and gave him a friendly , close-lipped smile , but when he did not speak she went back wordlessly to her task . Now it was the lower extremities that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange big-toe digits into narrow depressions perpendicular to the feet . 

 " That sounds like freedom , " observed the waitress , and walked away without saying anything else .  Picking up her fork , Carlin took her first bite . The not- &shy; apple pie was amazingly good . For a minute , maybe two , she forgot all her troubles and simply indulged her taste buds . The crust was flaky and buttery , and the filling was perfectly sweetened . The coffee was good , too . She took a deep breath , and realized that it was the first time in weeks that she could honestly say she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd take it . 

 I looked at Bayta , saw the tightness around her mouth . " Indeed , " I murmured .  Only I doubted it was the heavens that had supplied the crippled Nemut with this sudden largesse . This gift had come from much lower down , from the general vicinity of hell . 

 Shan stepped to his truck , pulled his battered binoculars from the dashboard and focused them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reported a moment later . " He 's chasing a man . " The figure in front struggled to balance a sack and a long object across his shoulders , running with a bent , uneven gait .  With a worried , confused expression , Lokesh raised a finger and traced in the air the course of the path the running figures followed . " It is the way to that new Chinese town ! " he warned , pointing to where the trail disappeared over the crest of the ridge . " He does n't realize where he 's being led ! " 

 E mma Bannon , Sorceress Prime and servant to Britannia 's current incarnation , mentally ran through every foul word that would never cross the lips of a lady . She timed them to the clockhorse 's steady jogtrot , and her awareness dilated . The simmering cauldron of the streets was just as it always was ; there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had not been earlier , either , when she had been a quarter-hour too late to save the other unregistered mentath . It was only one of the many things about this situation seemingly designed to try her often considerable patience .  Mikal would be taking the rooftop road , running while she sat at ease in a hired carriage . It was the knowledge that while he did so he could forget some things that eased her conscience , though not completely . 

 Blood samples were taken from the outside of Subject 139b 's hand and sequenced to prove that they belonged to the subject . Analysis of these samples confirmed the infection . ( For proof of live viral bodies in Subject 139b 's blood , see the attached file . ) Amplification appears to have begun normally , and followed the established progression toward full loss of cognitive functionality . Samples taken from Subject 139b 's clothing confirm this diagnosis .  Subject 139b was given a blood test shortly after arriving at this facility , and tested clean of all live viral particles . Subject 139b was given a second test , using a more sensitive unit , and once again tested clean . After forty-eight hours of isolation , following standard Kellis-Amberlee quarantine procedures , it is my professional opinion that the subject is not now infected , and does not represent a danger to himself or others . 

 Dawson stroked the dead cat 's fur as he weighed what to say next . The kingdoms of Asterilhold and Antea were like brothers . In centuries before , they had answered to the same High King . Several generations back , the noble houses had made a fashion of intermarrying in hopes that it would drive their nations toward peace . Instead it had confused the bloodlines and given dukes in Asterilhold a plausible claim to the Antean throne . If only you killed enough of the people in between .  It was the fate of all reforms that they turned against the reformers . History was rotten with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the image they had created of it . Inevitably , they failed . The world resisted change , and the nobleman 's role was to protect the right order of things . If only that order were always clear . He caressed the dead animal one last time and let his fingers fall from it . 

 As Anna turned toward the house , she heard the sound of a boat 's motor coming up the river . Pausing to listen to the rhythm of the engine , she could n't help but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How she missed deep chortling echoing along the hills of the river . She missed Henry , too . As well as Babette ... and so many others . Times and people had changed over the years , but the Siuslaw River remained the same , moving out to the sea , being pushed back gently with the incoming tide , always on the move .  Her people had lived alongside and loved this river for countless generations before her . Her grandmother 's old stories made references to them . According to Hazel 's research , the Siuslaw had been a matriarchal society . And Anna had known that it was the women who had handed down the traditions and what little belongings that were accumulated in a lifetime . Anna had always hoped to do the same , to leave a timeless inheritance for the generations that followed her , from Lauren to Sarah ... to Sarah 's descendants . But it seemed that was not meant to be . Perhaps the heritage of the shining waters was going to end far sooner than she 'd expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the boat 's engine slowing down , and when she looked , it was veering toward their dock . It looked like the Greeley 's Groceries boat . In an attempt to increase business , the store in town had decided to make deliveries on the river during the tourist months . Mostly , Anna supposed , because the youngest Greeley boy wanted an excuse to have a motorboat . But their groceries had been delivered yesterday , and she was n't expecting anything else today . Cupping her hand over her eyes , she peered to see Bobby Greeley at the helm . Sure enough , he was stopping at their dock . 

 Safe .  But hell if at the next bolt of lightning , he did n't try to jump out of his own skin . Pissed at the weakness , Ty shut the window . He was never inhaling an entire pepperoni pizza before bed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as pizza that made him dream badly . It was the edginess that came from being idle . His work was still special ops , but he had n't gone back to being a first responder trauma paramedic . Instead , he 'd signed up as a private contractor to the government , which was a decent enough adrenaline rush . Plus it suited himor it had until six months ago , when on an assignment he 'd had to jump out a second story window to avoid being shot , and had reinjured his leg . 

 Hanani sat , and the servant girl withdrew on some unseen signal from Danneh.  " I 've come to offer apology , " Hanani said , once a peaceable amount of silence had passed . Inwardly Hanani held herself rigid , though she had already decided that she would accept whatever words the woman flung at her , endure whatever rage . " I feel I have some responsibility for your husband 's death . It was my assistant who took his donation that day . " 

 Luggage Boy . Something else they 're going to carve on my tombstone .  Dagmar Shaw sits at her table , her head haloed from above by a big coach light on a black iron bracket . The first thing I think is Interesting fashion choice . Because her hair is a smooth uniform gray , the color of charcoal ash , and you do n't see that here , and she 's too young for gray hair anywayshe seems to be in her mid- ? thirties . Because no women in my part of the world have gray hair at all , she looks more striking than all but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set above eyes that are looking at me with a kind of half-puzzled expression . It 's the look that registers wrongness without quite being able to work out what the wrongness is . I 'm used to it , I see it a lot . 

 Queen Shaira rounded the corner of the hedge maze with two palace guards in tow . Shaira was not a tall woman , but her presence loomed as that of a Giantess . Her hair was dark and her eyes bright as emeralds , both like her daughter 's . Looking at her mother , standing there in her gown of purple silk and white brocade , a crown of silver and diamond circling her brow , Sharadza knew exactly what she would look like when she was grown . There could be no doubt that she would be the spitting image of her beautiful and regal mother . At the age of forty-five , Shaira retained every bit of her beauty , and this gave Sharadza no small comfort .  Her mother called her name , and smiled at her in that loving way that nobody else could ever smile . In the warmth of that smile , the day felt a bit less cool . The blaze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the fact that Shaira had grown up in a desert kingdom , or maybe her love itself was the source of the heat . 

 " Now I know we 're lost , " Stella says .  " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the sign outside the library that tells him . NORUMBEGA . He has heard the name , the old , unaccustomed Indian sound of it set here , in this part of the state , against names like Harvard , Sudbury , Ayer , like a town making a deliberate attempt to hide itself , or to claim its specialness. 

 " They exude refinement and grace , " Nimbus corrected . " Qualities , if you do n't mind me saying , from which you could benefit . I know knights in the field dress in order to bully rabble-rousers and brigands , and under such circumstances , it 's appropriate to select garments based on certain utilitarian qualities . " He took an appraising look at Hadrian 's attire . " But you are at the palace now , competing with a higher class of thug . A strong arm and loud voice will not be enough . You need to sell yourself to the knights you wish to intimidate , to the ladies you wish to bed , to the lords you wish to impress , and to the commoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last group is particularly important , as it will raise your stature with the others .  " A knight skilled in combat may stay alive , but it is the one skilled in persuasion who wins the king 's daughter for his wife and retires to a vast estate . Truly successful knights can obtain multiple fiefs and enter their twilight years as wealthy as any count or earl . " 

 Or would have , had he owned such a suit .  But it was the aforementioned scowl that was the real problem for any potential lover .

 He moved the cursor up and down the screen , uncharacteristically indecisive.  Maybe it was the fact that he was in New York on Bureau business as a representative at a security conference . He 'd always had a complicated relationship with the city . 

 I would have replied , but just then the bells of Saint Peter 's grew louder , their voices joined by the bells of churches all over Rome . Together they hailed the day of consecration for Holy Mother Church 's newest and most unwilling prince .  The bells were still ringing as I made my way across Rome . Despite its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets were busy . His Holinessa man of commerce himselfhad designated virtually every enterprise in the city as " necessary , " and therefore exempt from closing on holy days . For that , and for reining in the crime that had been rampant in the streets during the tenure of his predecessor , Romans loved him . But theirs was no longer the giddy love of first infatuation that brings a blush to the cheek and a glow to the eyes . Rather it was the brittle love of experience that teeters on the edge of disillusionment , when the faithlessness of the beloved is becoming all too evident . 

 " For a double sawbuck ? You 're a little light . "  " It 's the thought that counts , " he said . " See you around the campus , Jack . " 

 * * *  ALONG THE RIVER , THE market was already coming back , growing up around the ruins of the day before . The singsong calls of vendors , the shrieks of birds , gutter talk of larger animals , goats , cows . A troop of monkeys patrolled the dark , dank aisles , turning wares in their hands . The occupying soldiers were off the ground , standing in the backs of jeeps , behind weapons of comical size . The vehicles verging on tipping over . Propaganda barking from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . It is the resistance that fights us . Sunny Jim was already watching the soldiers ' eyes , was gone before Reverend Bauxite knew it . Sunny Jim 's gift , he thought , was to become invisible , granted because there was so little keeping him here . He watched a soldier watching him , a woman with a ponytail sneaking out from under her helmet . The helmet too big , the jacket too small . The soldier turned to Reverend Bauxite , eyebrows raised . Seemed to see in him , then , all that he had done , for he was not like Sunny Jim . He was an open man , his passions playing in the air around him . The same thing that made him a fire , a beacon , in the pulpit , made him a failure at espionage . They should have left days ago , he thought . Gone north and found Aaron , then west , across all that land . The war could not have broken it all . They still could go , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until Reverend Bauxite and Sunny Jim were just two more men who died somewhere back in all that fighting , and their new selves were free . 

 Mr. Elliot fished a pack of Chesterfields from his coat pocket , shook a cigarette out despite a NO SMOKING sign not twenty feet away , and used an old Zippo to light it . He smoked , and I watched the water . A gentle wake crested behind the boat , but I could just barely hear it over the riverboat 's engine . I heard voices , laughter , and footsteps as excited tourists moved to the starboard side of the boat . I followed their movement . The George Washington Monument pierced the air like a giant spike . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flying saucer above columns of snow-white marble .  That 's how people reacted when they came to D.C. They saw the White House and the Library of Congress . They stared into Lincoln 's eyes and marveled at the names on the Vietnam Memorial . They gazed into the Reflecting Pool and tipped their heads to the sea of white at Arlington Cemetery . And they felt something . These were the symbols of their country , and they felt something . Pride , freedom , security . Who knew ? But it was my job to protect that something . And if it meant a black op in the heart of most dangerous country on earth , well , so be it .
